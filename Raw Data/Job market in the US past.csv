WSJ markets ...,2019-08-06T16:46:29Z,@Harry-qh5rt,"Those wages will level out. We're early in the plan to bring back jobs to America. The problem is that we're trying to compete on a playing field that is not level. The theory that supports this is that Americans were supposed to keep the well paying jobs while the lower paying jobs were sent to countries that have lower wages. In theory, this is a win-win (pareto efficiency) in that the lower wage countries get jobs that increase their standard of living and produce goods at a lower cost for the other country. What is missed in this equation is that grass roots industry, most times a manufacturing/value-add types of industry, are the basis of more complex economies. It is a multiplier effect with a high number of instances of a low multiplier. All these instances combined leads to a large impact. Add to this that the technology that is the basis of the economic advantage that produces the high paying jobs does not stay unique for long periods, and you have those jobs too becoming portable. Why have a manufacturing team on one side of the globe, creating material communication and responsiveness issues with the engineering team on the other side of the globe? Move the engineering to the same location as manufacturing and you have a more responsive company.   That said, we are in the process of leveling that playing field with economic tooling. The jobs are starting to come back and we will start to see the multiplier effect and labour supply/demand fill in the missing middle class. It is a very interesting time to be alive! We are witnessing the reversal of decades of bad policy.   The only part we don't fully see yet is how this will shake out in a stock market that makes it's money on growth. I think the time of free money is coming to a close, along with the close of abusive economic policy.",2019-12-10T17:48:03Z,2

They are therefore as bad as the companies they sought to oppose. Who can we organize to oppose the oligarchical bureaucracy of the unions themselves?    I do oppose non-compete agreements, anything that is anticompetitive is generally going to impoverish most and enrich a smaller subset. However, if a company is going to train someone, it does make sense to have a limited duration non-compete (not one that is after you leave, but one that is from the start date). We need to encourage companies to train their employees: schools are too expensive now and need some competition to the job training world.    Automation certainly can pose a problem but there is so much opportunity in other areas but people can't quickly (if at all in certain situations) re-tool so that is a genuine problem.   But the other issue you didn't cover is government regulation: it stifles competition and limits business growth/startups. Government restrictions typically benefit the larger company since they can more easily comply. Since small business owners make up the lion's share of the employers, we need to figure out how to encourage this demographic.",2019-08-06T20:49:53Z,8

A couple of recommendations for a preppers: put your dried food up in Mylar bags in 5-gallon buckets from Lowe's or Walmart or wherever.  If you are storing water, keep your storage in a dark room or covered.  It will grow algae if light gets to it. Educate yourself on food storage. Don't just throw plastic bags of  beans and rice into a tub. Bugs will get into them, and they will certainly take on the flavor of the plastic.

There are different levels in how to prep. One layer all need to consider is prepping with or without electricity. No electricity then you have no working toilets, no heat or air conditioning, no refrigeration and perhaps no gas from gas stations etc. Do you know hoe to make your own toilette? Dispose of waste? Do have material or backup heating sources like propane single stove to make heat or a fire? Do you have caste iron skillet or a cowboy coffee pot? Do you know how to disinfect water? Do you know how to make your own wine, beer or spirits? Good bartering material. Anyway, there is a book called One Second After by William Forstchen with a forward by Newt Gingrich. It's about a family and their community during a grid outage that lasts over a year. It's about how people change between family members, friends and community when it becomes everyone for themselves once the supplies disappear. I highly recommend reading it. Even if you don't prep herein for life without a grid, you are at least aware of what may be so you know what to expect and how to react if it happens.

Make classes mandatory for a quarter or semester and make it fun and hands on. Not boring and all book work. Other things can be introduced like some math or plans. Plumbing, building, electrical, science. Weed through and sort. Turn education around. Stop shoving memorization, homework and contant tests at students. Make high school PE more spontaneous. Let students be more creative with music and art. A lot of money and time is being wasted. Im so glad my kids are out of school. It was so bad. My own experience in the 60s wasn't much better but I did stick it out for four years. Girls didn't do wood shop or mechanics. You had to be in calculus to be in drafting. I was lucky to do two years of basic math but drawing house plans really interested me and still do to this day. I might have learned more math if reverse engineered. Make art and home ec. mandatory for a semester. Find the students (boys) that like to cook or sew or who don't (girls).  Im mechanically inclined and don't like to cook. Im female. It may have saved me a lot of suffering and junk low paying jobs. I worked for years. Now retired my SS retirement is so low that I qualify for all kinds of assistance. I could not save. Am a republicans nightmare. This is not how I was raised. I had proud hardworking parents that instilled independence and you work for a living. Not welfare and handouts.

Allah will hold you to account for that Riba which you can avoid even if you had to flee to the mountains sides where rain falls and take with you some sheep and goats.  Imran Hosein - THE PROHIBITION of RIBA (Interest) [FULL VIDEO] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKm3J3gJV8c  This shaykh has deep understanding of the harm of RIBA. After listening to his lecture I understood why Allah SWT has declared war on people who deal with RIBA in society, because these people give power to control money to money landers/bankers who in turn put people in slavery and hardship and also can finance a war just by printing unlimited amount of paper money and kills those who oppose them.  And the blood of those innocent people are also on the hands of those who give them RIBA/interest on loan money. Those who are willingly cooperate with them for a small worldly gain will be with Abu Lahab and Abu Jahal in hellfire for ever because they also financed war against believers.

eiZ21Niz5Lc,"Robots, automation bringing more jobs, productivity to US economy?",ROBO Global CIO Bill Studebaker on the impact of robots and increased automation on the job market.,2018-07-09T16:07:14Z,@TheServantofSatan,"Let's look at one part of his argument. It is true that Amazon is hiring thousands of employees to pick the orders in their warehouses as more people place orders online. It is also true that those warehouses are highly automated with the robots picking up the shelves and taking them to the human picker to package for the customers.  The issue that's not being addressed is that Amazon holds a yearly contest where people design robots to replace those workers. So far those robots have been found wanting in this department, but, as with all technology, as more and more companies and startups look to grab this golden ring and become the supplier to Amazon, it is only a matter of time before a company solves this particular problem due to the competition and speed with which technology moves. In other words, those jobs are, at best, temporary. (In fact, I read an article just the other day that states that a company has already solved this problem. Whether or not that is true remains to be seen.)  One of the largest costs to businesses are labor. Automation is specifically designed to lower this cost. If I'm an employer, why would I want to keep the same amount of employees on my payroll if I can substitute them for automation which can be depreciated over time, replaced at a specific cost, and sold for scrap at the end of its life? Automation doesn't call in sick, doesn't need vacations, and can work as many hours and you want without extra pay. There is very few downsides to replacing the worker from the employers point of view.",2018-07-10T00:19:30Z,0

The inflation indicator used by the Fed takes into account job benefits like insurance that will fall moreso on the employer due to hyperinflation in healthcare. If all the new jobs don't have benefits, then the cost of medical care falls on the consumer, which is best measured by CPI iirc. The CPI has been showing that wages have either stagnated or failed to keep up with inflation. Furthermore, the wage growth that is being measured is likely predominantly in the upper-class of wealth. We all know the statistic about how much CEO pay has outstripped worker pay over the years, so it's probably the case that competition for labour is only occurring in the upper-class. There won't be any increase in demand if the person's buying power remains the same, and a definitely decrease if the cost of living continues to increase while wages stagnate. If the Fed wants inflation, it should figure out a better way to give money to a broader range of consumers, because it isn't really trickling down atm while the cost of living increases.",2019-10-03T12:03:54Z,1
