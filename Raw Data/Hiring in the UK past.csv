I have repeatedly reviewed the behavioral and situational questions you recommended and have found them to be helpful in reinforcing tips such as listening carefully, taking time to organize ideas, practicing beforehand, be specific, drawing from experiences in different fields including volunteering (which I usually never discuss unless asked), and not hesitating to ask politely for clarification if needed. It's also important to control anxiety through meditation and journaling, and to break the ice with small talk at the beginning of the interview. Additionally, practicing with another English speaker, talking to a mirror, or recording videos to check body language and intonation can help project the right image and leadership. Thank you for sharing this training material.",2023-04-06T18:03:41Z,4

I am a Nepali Hindu Gurkha who served in the British Army and I am highly disappointed with the UK. Gurkhas have been serving British army for decades & when I got recruited for the Army I was excited but, soon I've realised that UK has forgotten about us or simply ignoring us because Hindus don't go around violently asking for their rights. I couldn't bring my family from Nepal and it was even hard for me to get residency for my wife. I wanted to look after my parents but, we Gurkhas had to fight for our rights despite of dying for this country while people who fought ISIS were welcomed in the UK with all benefits.  Not just Hindu Gurkhas even Sikh soldiers feels like they're being ignored because British army wants to be so sympathetic to the Muslims. I am not asking them to discriminate Muslims but, why are you ignoring us that's all.  Most Hindus don't eat beef but, army canteen seems to have love with Halal food that they forgot that there are more Hindus and Sikhs in the British army than Muslims. Hardly any vegetarian options were available. I personally disliked Halal method of killing animals as I eat chicken sometimes but, I've had no other options but to eat Halal food.  I've stopped working for the army now & new generation Gurkhas are slowly losing interest to join army due to no recognition of Hindus & Gurkhas in the army. I would expect some sort of respect from the government but, no one seems to care.  Our religion don't teach us to spread violence to get an attention but, I just want to ask one question to Briton Do you need a Gurkha who is willing to defend your country or an ISIS supporter who wants to destroy your country ?

When first set up employment agencies were ran through a governmental body. The person being employed didn’t come with overheads, you were placed and the company only had to pay for your labour, not a middle man. These agencies push up labour costs, yet those who are employed through them don’t see the benefit. Bring back non for profit agencies supervised through a system not geared to exploit the workforce. My eldest sons aunt set up Morestaff in Luton. She’s a multi millionaire, all earned through this system. She used to work for Blue Arrow, but left and basically stole their client list. Through this kind of Chicanery and greed workers earn roughly 33% of the agency’s charges on long placements..

I've been unemployed since June and don't know what to do at this point honestly. I feel like walking in seems like a big waste of time but at the same time when you apply online at home you also don't hear anything back. It's like a lose-lose situation to where you almost have to beg and keep calling back the company for a job. If it wasn't for my mom harping at me to get a job every 30 seconds and getting dirty looks for not helping out around the house and all of this BS then I wouldn't care about getting one to begin with honestly. I told her I didn't want my next job to make me feel enslaved like my last job of almost 6 years that I hated so much and she keeps aggravating me and telling me to take whatever I can get. She knows I have anxiety and she's just not making it easy on me because that's all I ever hear her complain about. The worst thing about job hunting is you have outsiders looking down on you and treating you like dirt all because they think it's so easy when it's not easy to find one.,2020-02-08T17:43:43Z,27

I have applied for just over 500 jobs(non entertainment jobs let's specify. I've done random voice work to keep my busy but even that is far between) and I've only had two interviews. And then I keep seeing the same job posting from the same company week after week and then when I ask they claim they are not hiring. Since the last three years the big probis that we lost a lot of our visa workers which is exactly what people want as a company; because those people can be taken advantage of. That's one of the biggest issues. And the biggest now issues come from tech where we no longer need in person staff to do a job but computers. And those jobs aren't replaced.

It depends what you want, but I can certainly recommend for anyone not that confident that they try the Monmouthshire and Brecon canal (Mon & Brec). It's only 35 miles long and has 6 locks, so you can do the whole length and back in a week relatively easily. It is also beautiful, and because it isn't connected to the rest of the network, it is never too busy. I have had two holidays on the canal and both times hired from Castle Narrowboats who were excellent. You can even hire electric drive boats from them and the canal has charge points along the canal to recharge. Hope this helps someone :)",2019-07-23T21:47:17Z,18

We'd flown in from Vancouver so jetlagged all to heck. They took us out onto the Thames to make sure we could turn around and then sweetly said Have a nice holiday. We headed up the Thames a couple of hundred yards came around the corner into the first lock and it was jammed with expensive fibreglass cruisers and the lock keeper was happily waving us in. My god, tired, unsure of my ability to steer a steel narrowboat, fear of nailing one of those expensive ones. Ugh! We made it successfully thanks to the lock keeper (it was on the Thames). We moored up right outside the lock on Eton Common (or whatever they called it) and collapsed. We went on to have two of the most enjoyable weeks holidays we've ever had. Everything got easier once we'd slept a bit. And we moored right outside both Windsor Castle and Hampton Court not to mention sundry pubs :) .",2019-08-01T22:55:50Z,8

We are all comfortable on the water with variety of experiences though not with a narrowboat.  We are looking for a nice, one week tour cruising for 30-35 hours in total...at least that is the plan now.   We are Canadians and very used to spending time in transit. As long as there is a nice pub at the end of the day.  We are still very much in the planning stage.  Cheers.",2019-12-11T02:40:10Z,0

Le_8pKc3F2M,Hiring A Business Coach | App Developer UK,"""Hiring A Business Coach""- The Daily Overpass #601 Today Eric talks about how ""Hiring A Business Coach"". Please don't ...",2019-02-07T12:00:07Z,@rexservice,"Hi Eric, great topic. As an old guy I can say I was helped greatly by coaching and mentoring on several levels.  You can skip to the bottom for the punch line . . . . .  When I was young there were customers or people that 'just dropped by' that were older, maybe retired or semi retired and had a vast array of knowledge. I would take 30 minutes or an hour to sit in my office or go and get a cup of coffee to discuss a wide variety of topics a couple times a month. These people were often very intelligent and experienced in many areas. I would save some of my divergent ideas and questions about specific topics for these impromptu sessions. Sometimes you have to be pretty brutal to conserve your own time, but you cannot get sucked into only listening to old 'war stories'.  The second group was kind of a breakfast club that met early Saturday mornings. The people at the table would be business owners of different business types, often millionaires, (back when a million was a big number) and a big dog in their market. (Chicago - South Side) Every Saturday we would solve every problem of the world, including some of our own business problems. These were guys you could call ask about their experience with . . . .? or even something as mundane as getting a new HVAC contractor.  I was in a larger group that met twice a year and we were known unofficially as the 'dirty dozen'. We were the ~12 largest independents in the country but usually not overlapping each other. Because we did not compete with each other, but performed the same services we could share everything we did. These were mostly multi-location, always the largest in their market and often had 50 or more employees. This group could even move the market slightly and often had manufacturers or nation wide retailers as guest speakers.  I also saw a life coach / psychologist for a couple years with great success.   The main point is that you can benefit from a wide variety of groups or services but if you do not benefit greatly within a matter of few hours, drop that one and find something that really works for you.

Please don't ...",2019-02-07T12:00:07Z,@DaveStewartLondon,"Coaching is great, but was really hoping you would cover the areas you got coached in, what were your blind spots, what were the aha moments, what didn't you know that you didn't know, what track has the coach put you on, where will you be in 12 months, what does an average coaching session cover. So you're accountable; can you share specifics? It would be useful to demonstrate the benefits in a more tangible way.",2019-02-08T11:30:42Z,1

Please don't ...",2019-02-07T12:00:07Z,@chordfunc3072,"Is a business coach worth it? This is just my take on it... I think it depends on where you are. To me, it probably wouldn't be worth it at this time. This is mainly because the utility function of my money is so high because I don't really have enough of it.  Don't get me wrong I can survive, but hiring a coach would bite too much into my budget at this point.   Having a kind of mentor is something that I can see the benefit in... I don't really know that many entrepreneurial people and I live in a small town at the moment, so I rely on people like yourself, and John Sonmez to kind of be my ""coach"". I also read a lot, and listen to audio books. Some of the books that I've heard a lot of times that have shifted my perspective on money and business are ''The Millionaire Fastlane"" and the ""Rich dad poor dad! ""books.   Someday, I would love to have a coach or mentor that I could talk with in person, but at the level(pretty low that is😂), I'm currently I think I can get a greater return on my money in other ways.",2019-02-08T13:55:03Z,0
