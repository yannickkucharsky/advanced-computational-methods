Any regular job ain't going to pay you 200k in my country, not even top ceo jobs pay that much in Norway. You need to do it yourself trough investments or you ain't getting out of that ditch. Norway is not the place for the rich, it's the place for the middle class that want to live in a kindergarten for adults. And don't forget that 30-50% of that 200k you earned is going to be tax.

As for the security aspect, we should be less worried about a guy with sandals and backpack coming across the border, and more worried about our digital and infrastructure vulnerabilities, and our enemy governments buying up acres of real estate next door to us.   This was common sense. But people are voting with their emotions, not their brains.",2025-09-26T20:19:39Z,984

You can make a living on that, if you are willing to accept that you have really crappy living conditions, but that it allows you to send your earnings back home to a family where a dollar can buy you a lot more than it can in the US. However, if you are an American and want to feed an entire family living in the US based solely on what you earn working the same job, it can't be done, due to the increase in the cost living. So to sum it up, the living conditions of that immigrant is so much different from that of a permanent resident, and if you as a farmer need to pay your workers an American level pay, you'd have to raise the price of your produce, which tends to make your products harder to sell and inhibit the economy, which has a tendency to reduce amount of jobs available.

These are the jobs that most young Americans will not do.  Now, office cleaners, hospital environmental services, hotel environmental services and food prep are short staffed yet the businesses have lost revenue so they cannot or will not hire someone.   Good hardworking folks were treated awful when they came here to the land of opportunity, the melting pot, the land of freedom for what.

Think about it...if a company has 100 employees and the 5 lowest paid make a combined salary of 150,000, then the CEO would have to find a way to pay the lowest paid 5 more salary, which means he would have to increase other salaries for employees above the lowest paid 5, in order to in turn give themselves a raise.

bbZbxo20XL8,California Employment Law: Two Week Notice #worklife,,2025-06-30T23:37:34Z,@adam37886,"EDIT to clarify: Yes, it is most likely, depending on the state, perfectly legal to terminate the employment. That isn't what the comment said. I said you either schedule the employee during their notice period, or you've terminated them. Employers are well within their legal right to do so. I never said they couldn't. However, at least in the state where I live and own a business, if you do not let the employee work their notice, you have fired them. In my state, not letting the employee work their notice is considered termination, without cause, and while legal, will allow them to successfully file an unemployment claim. Successful unemployment claims raise your unemployment rates. You can do it if you want, but if they file, you'll take the unemployment hit. Responders were too focused on it being legal or not, but that's not what my comment addressed. No where did I say anything about it being legal to not let an employee work their notice. People who went that direction, either can't read, or just decided to do their own comment thread, under my comment, pretending I said something I didn't say.   Original comment:  I gave you a notice of an intent to quit. I don't actually quit until my last day. You told me I wasn't welcome back as of this moment. I haven't quit yet, so either I'm welcome to come back for my shift tomorrow, or I'm fired. If I'm not fired, I'll be back tomorrow.",2025-07-01T03:47:57Z,6786

He has two reasons for this and the first is security. He owns a large landscaping and hauling company and he has had ppl quit then steal a bunch of stuff on their last day. Often that stuff is much much more than their last 2 weeks pay and recovering it is difficult. They are caught alot of the time but the items are almost never recovered as they were pawned the same day in most cases.

The CA course, including Foundation, Intermediate, and Final levels, typically takes a minimum of 4.5 to 5 years to complete. This includes the required articleship training period of three years. Even for graduates entering through the direct entry route, the minimum duration is 4.5 years.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  Foundation Level: 6 months Intermediate Level: 8-10 months Articleship Training: 3 years Final Level: 6-12 months While some students might be able to accelerate their studies by studying intensely, passing exams quickly, and potentially completing the final level in one year after clearing the intermediate level, this would be an exception rather than the norm.

Not considering 3 years of ug required for mba: so mba 5 years Whereas CA can be done after 12 only, and can become CA in 4 years only in first attempt (I am going to become, so telling actually). So you will become CA 1 year earlier than MBA.  2. CAs also get opportunity in areas non CA people get after MBA today ie. Mgt consulting, inv banking, pe etc. which have package of 20-30 lakhs. Yes but it is only for rankers and highly scoring and good profile students.  3. And in these roles, then you will assume growth same as mba.  Also, CA saves on 2 years cost of mba + 2 years salary , which is roughly equal to 80 lakhs of savings.  And even if CA wants to do MBA, they easily get 99.99%ile and also have special seats in IIM A. So can get that too easily.",2025-10-21T15:36:01Z,7

It’s due to 50 years of one sided politics and rabid environmental policies. The other reason is that it cheaper to refine lighter crude from elsewhere such as comes from The Middle East. No new refineries are being built because of The N.I.M.B.Y.

I only work 3 days a week! That's no joke, and it's all because employees want to work from home, which means that they actually don't do any work period but get paid for 5 while us contractors only get paid for 3!

Adjusted for inflation, that would be about $11.15 today. That may not sound like a lot of money, but we weren’t supporting a family with that kind of money. That’s because those jobs were never meant to support a family!  Back in high school, I lived in a small town in the Mojave Desert where two highways connected. The town was full of fast food restaurants and gas stations which was cool because it gave all of us in high school a place to work. No one except the managers, was working at McDonald’s to raise a family. We were all working there to pay for the gas in our cars, take out our dates, buy our weed (Yes I said it), or whatever else we needed money for. That’s exactly what those jobs were for. And most of us kept those jobs until we graduated.  Perhaps the most important part of those jobs was that it taught us to be responsible. Those were important skills to learn in high school.

She barely worked after qualifications. She doesn't have any idea about the opportunity out there for CAs no matter how many attempts it took for them to qualify. There are many CAs working at large multinationals at leadership positions despite taking attempts to pass exam and earning in crores and still working day in and day out without hogging the limelight. The reason being they don't brag about it on social media unlike her whose only way to earn money is by making videos that only reflect her mental bankruptcy.,2025-05-23T21:32:28Z,13

I am a new friend here at your channel, but I just wanted to say how much I LOVE how you encourage others to clap and support others! I used to host karaoke, and I kinda ""made"" people clap for performers, especially the ones who werent the best singers. My saying was ""We always clap for our friends because they had the cohones to get up here and sing!"" And that usually encouraged good applause. You basically do the same thing and I LOVE IT!

I'm taking a leap of faith with you. So many influencers give bogus jobs that are supposedly always hiring or that are really good jobs and it ends up being nothing but spam. I'm not even sure what made me click on the video in the first place but something told me to do it while I was cleaning and after listening I have decided to come back and to take notes. If I actually get a job because you gave me the information I don't even know what I can do in return for you because I am in desperate need of one and it would be a blessing to actually get a decent job especially if it's remote in which I don't have to worry about trying to find a ride nor walking for hours just to get to and from work.",2025-08-03T19:48:32Z,1

I was placed on field experience this past semester, and the higher-ups decided I'm not safe around kids. Not safe around 2-year-olds, but fine around 4-year-olds. I'm smart enough to read between the lines. Just to be clear, nothing happened with anyone's safety. No one crashed, no one got hurt. They just didn't like it when I said that I don't like being touched by adults, but I'm okay if the kids do it. I left the placement. People judge ne. They tell me that I should have told someone, that I was supposed to push through. But the way I think about it is this way: if I let these people get away with it, what grounds would I have to stand on when I'm employed in the future? What grounds would I stand on when people discriminate against me, make assumptions about me, or be disrespectful toward me for no reason other than them being in higher position than me? It's a rule I have for myself, with my family included: if you disrespect me, I walk away. I've cut off my father for years because he dared to fake his own death and test a boundary I have. No guilt-tripping worked, and I told him off. What makes people think I can't do it to literal strangers just because they're paying me is beyond me.",2025-06-14T14:43:11Z,1

We are Americans. If something needs done, we do it. We don’t wait around for politicians to give us the attention by sucking up to them or by holding our tongue so we don’t hurt our chances for the govt attention. That is absurd. Use your networking with private business owners, the community, and even investors from outside the area. Become what you know your city could be, generate that interest. The California legislature has no interest in improving business in this state, nor improving the lives of taxpayers/citizens. The party is all that matters. No one strays outside the lines or they lose their chance to be elected next time around. They are bought & paid for. Stop relying on others to do for you that which you can do for yourself! Use your political pull to ease regulations to allow development in your area. The agriculture in your area needs support & the new administration is trying to improve the opportunity for farmers but it will not be instant. Keep on thinking of ways to improve your city without growing the govt…it’s the only way to improve the lives of those who live there. Best of luck, sir.",2025-05-31T22:20:06Z,5

Definitely has a very promising advance political future. 👏🤩  I would like to say that even though we currently have lots of water we must not forget we are a demographical a desert area so we  naturally don’t have water here but rather it is diverted from the Colorado River to our Imperial Valley. We always want to keep this in mind because we would quickly dry up if for any reason whether political or national disaster water wasn’t diverted our way.   Mexicali continues to rapidly and beautifully expand. It’s very difficult to compete as there is no comparison between regulations in Mexico and California. Mexicali has been attracting aerospace, auto and other corporations since the 1960s. We may want to see how we can collaborate and streamline manufacturing and process services by continuing offering  job opportunities in import and export arena. I would say truck driving but due to self operating vehicles that may not pan out in the future. Needs to be researched. Possibly offering job opportunities and creation in AI in combination with continual efforts to attract twin maquiladora and processing plants, logistics, shipping services. Tax credits helped implement job opportunities in the 1990s and early 2000s.   Which brings me back to that even though it hurts us to see businesses fail and leave, at the end it’s their bottom line.  If it’s no longer profitable then how can you expect them to stay open? So answers lay in how can that be made possible? How can the bottom line be profitable? Could we offer incentives and/or tax credits?  At one point we kept Brawley Beef open when it was going under by offering tax credits. Would it be easier and more efficient to get that implemented and approved than the current red tape of what currently being done. IDK but it’s definitely food for thought.",2025-06-03T16:44:44Z,0

The employee retirement account while nice on the surface are nothing more than a control measure to extort more money from employees .Who controls that money ? The state. Entry level jobs were designed for teenage children new to the workforce, generally with zero work experience, NOT undocumented workers. Seems like we’re all working for the communist mafia . Higher wages mean more taxes for the employee, severe financial stress for the employer already working on very slim margins . This results in very large increases for the state.

You order pay drive away then find out they didn't put it in a missing meal for someone, you tell them exactly how you want it,don't want lettuce etc. drive away open it there's  lettuce on it or what you want on it nope not there. They already can't add so they press coke,fries & total done for them & they can't count back your change they put in what you gave them the correct change comes up for them. They  can't count it back they hand it back to you in a wad. Outrageous is the fact home care people are paid much less & their responsibilities are more serious the care of a human & their  medications food,groceries,hygiene,laundry take important phone calls. Absolutely ridiculous they are paid so little. Including those who need this would get much better care from better workers that were paid a good wage. Born here lol what about the illegals working because they are and always have been. Lived in southern California close to the border. Have you ever worked in a restaurant bam!

They opened up our cul de sac and people began trafficking thru there and parking all their extra cars on our normally empty cul de sac. They should be sued. When people bought their homes in that area they bought them and payed the price BECAUSE it was a quiet neighborhood cul de sac. If you don’t think they can do this to you… or even go so far as to burn down your home think again.   We almost bought a house in a mixed residential/commercial zone. The seller would not give us the required documents to reveal this that the city required. Turns out, when I spoke to someone at city hall about the property, they said they recently re-zoned the area (without any notice) to make it only commercial and that if that house burns down, we would not be able to rebuild a residential home in its place.

Higher tax base in California is not the only major problem with California, you have to solve the issue with all the millions of folk in California who are on Medi-Cal and other state run assistance programs with costs $ billions in state revenues which comes from taxes to pay for. So what are you going to do with all the poor people in the state who live at home with their parents, or in apartments or homes that they can't afford but are getting state assistance to stay living in the state enjoying the nice warm and pleasant weather?
