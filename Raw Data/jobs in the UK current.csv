The only way that is even a livable wage is living in a poor/very rural area. Cost of living has surged and people are out of touch with how much it cost to live.   Rent where i live is an average of 1.6k-2k monthly where I live and a car payment is an average of 650 dollars which is necessary in the US as public transportation lacks anywhere outside a major city walls. That means you spend 66.25 percent on your income just on those bills alone. Add in taxes, emergencies, and all other bills you can’t make a living.",2025-08-21T12:58:06Z,25

I went back to get my Masters after 3 years experience in pathology (hospital laboratory). My degree was in Biomedical Science and I graduated in 2018, prior to my Master degree I was teaching for a couple of years (never again), yes it’s that bad!  Anyway, I knew I would need my Masters at one point or another so I went back to get it and specialised in Clinical Biochemistry.  In the 3 month gap between when I graduated and my final interview (March), I applied for around 30 jobs (including areas I had no experience in such as micro and haematology) and got the following interviews;  1. Interview as an Associate Practitioner (AP) in about 4 jobs (was my previous job before leaving). 2. An interview as a Medical Laboratory Assistant in two of them (including one in micro which required no experience but someone beat me). 3. Two interviews as a trainee Biomedical Scientist (one in virology and one in clinical chemistry).  Note, having the Biomedical Science degree itself is not enough to be a Biomedical Scientist. You also need to do a portfolio which grants you membership to the Health and Care Professions Council.  Anyway, back on topic. Even after attending said interviews (averaging 1 every 10 days) I got accepted for the best job I could have (the trainee post in chemistry) which was ironically the best paid job I’d applied for but it required me to move from home as it’s the best experience I could ask for.  I can tell you the job market out there is KILLER!

But they didn't, as soon as they lost 'graduate' status, they moved on. And the simple reason for that was that they didn't move salaries up enough while we were graduates, so salaries stagnated in highly skilled jobs, and we could see roles for up to double our salaries going on the outside. So I imagine a lot of grad roles have disappeared because companies didn't think they were getting a benefit out of it (staff retention), when in that all they had to do was be a little more proactive on internal progression/salary rises.",2025-07-14T14:31:02Z,2

As mentioned in the video, it is a combination of different reasons. Don't also forgot that the recent Autumn budget ensured companies have to pay for national insurance for employees, which provides less incentive for both hiring people and salary increases. I fear this is not the worse, and labour in this new budget will just increase taxes again.  Degrees do not have the same value as before. Gone is the linear model we have been feed, and continue to be fed, of get a good education, study get into a good university and life is sorted. Educational model needs to change.",2025-07-14T11:00:36Z,6

Its disheartening to say the least, and I'm sticking to it till I have just enough money to leave this train wreck of a country. I'm aware the situation isn't much better abroad but ill take my chances since I've not been offered anything better here and the situation isn't looking likely to change for the new few years. I live in the north of England and its dire, most people I know either cant find even a basic job generally or have also ditched getting their degrees since the outcome is always going to be the same unskilled labour or unemployment regardless of education. Sites like indeed are supposed to offer a way to apply for jobs you want to try but the grand majority of the times you apply, you will not get a response, I'm convinced they're fake listings to create the illusion of a job market because I've never once found a job off those kind of sites, or even heard of anyone getting a reply. I hate my job and its nothing to do with what I wanted to work in or be at, but I'm still considered one of the lucky ones to even have employment and its sickening. I will never own a house in this country they're beyond extortionately expensive and half the time in squalid condition from years of financial neglect or slumlords running them into the ground. As I grew up watching the political climate of the UK year by year I can say I have never wanted to jump ship so badly in all my life, the situation is not looking likely to improve and I'm not willing to sick around on the gamble that it might, better yet I cant stay too long in Europe thanks to Brexit so I'm effectively stuck in this shit heap. I will dedicate my free time and effort to finding a way to leave and never return, whatever the cost may be ill pay it, ill endure it, ill stick it out till that window of opportunity opens and never look back.

Also there is an issue with constant tiredness and lack of sleep. Thankfully these are no longer an issue. I have great pity for the young people I see every day either in school or at an early stage in their careers.

Companies grabbed these low wage workers as fast as they could 15 years ago and people like me, a farm worker at the time, couldn't get a job anywhere unless I took a 30-50% pay cut. Because people like me, a lifelong UK citizen, couldn't get a job younger people wouldn't train up for an industry that couldn't provide them a job with a liveable wage so we end up with a skills shortage. Now we have a country that's utilised cheap foreign labour for years and industries that now struggle to find people because the cheap workers have gone home and no-one is there to replace them. The wages are too low now for people living here to afford a reasonable standard of living, try getting a mortgage on £25k/year, energy costs at an all time high, fuel costs the same, rents are extortionate, no housing available unless you come here illegally, taxation at stupid levels.  I'm 57 and will be moving to the Philippines in the next 12-15 years as my GF is a citizen out there, she's coming to the UK soon and we're getting married and applying for her UK citizenship. That is at a cost of £7-£10k and I wonder how a penniless illegal affords that?? We have a house and business out in the Ph and I pay 8% tax instead of 40% in the UK, electric is about £50/month instead of £200+, fuel is at about 80p/l, my shopping is £60 instead of over £100 here for similar items, the cost of living is a lot lower and my life there will be no different than it is here in the UK.

Not that long ago, companies would train their own staff from ""the bottom"", which allowed more people to enter the company through entry-level jobs and progress to more skilled and senior roles as they worked and learned over the years. Now they require qualifications that are never tailored to the specific job or company, and quite often these are a requirement for entry-level jobs. It looks like they are saving on training staff, but the little training they save, it's not worth it. Companies had better employees back when they trained them from the very beginning, and they often had them for their entire working life. Back when I was in Spain during the construction boom, there was no shortage of ""qualified builders"", lots of 16-year-old kids would leave school and start learning from 0 as they worked in construction, and nobody had a problem with that.

It’s a sad way to look at the world and treat people, because we all have intrinsic value, and what “we do” isn’t the sum of who we are as people. We are more than our jobs or how we make money. This way of thinking makes people so transactional and makes it harder for people to truly connect.

Plus when you go for an interview for a unskilled job, for example a warehouse operative (picking and packing)the h.r team ask you the most ridiculous questions, what are your ambitions ,what can you bring to the team etc. I worked in a warehouse for over 12 years before I was made redundant and all I was asked was where I had worked before and was given a simple maths and english test.When we were being made redundant,we were given applications from another warehouse called pets at home. The first question on the form was what type of animal would you consider your self as and why? I was about to write I'm a donkey because I work like  a donkey and I'm hung like one. One of my colleagues went for an interview at pets at home,and he said they had to do a group task where they had to get a toy frog over the water. I said to him what has that got to do with picking and packing and he said it was BS. You need a PhD nowadays to work in a warehouse. Also another thing  I remember is that a gentleman came to our warehouse from a CV company when we were being made redundant, he said there is no such thing as Equal opportunities and he also said companies advertise outside just as a show,that they are a great company and have many people interviewed but they have already got a candidate for the job lined up. Also what p*sses me off,is the past CORRUPT government and present CORRUPT government want us to work till the day we die but they don't create jobs nor make the employers pay a living wage.",2025-05-12T14:55:31Z,45

Most firms want the Young, Dumb and full of C** type of person - probably a YES type who won't challenge organisation hierarchy. 6. Interview stages are created to deselect anyone smart, but if you are blessed with smarts, skills and experience beyond the over blown expectations, they just don't want those who are too smart eg: being confronted with good ideas or solutions to problems etc. 7.

The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot.""",2025-07-17T20:45:31Z,118

I have done btech cse. 2 years after graduation no job. I got only private universities in germany. I don't know which universities will accept me with my cgpa . Anyone knows where I can apply to for the next year March intake summer one. Also my another doubt is I am also considering Australia, netherlands (which doesn't have public universities but at least it has better private universities than that in Germany) , Austria (but have heard their public universities CGPA demand is more than that of the public universities in Germany so I don't know) .

Jobs become low paid insecure and hard to get. Crime rises Rents rise and Mortgages become impossible for young people to obtain. When that happens young people are disenfranchised from raising a family and getting married. When that happens people stop spending and businesses start to close down due to high crime high taxes and lack of footfall. This is all a precursor to the the introduction of UBI which will be based on how many people are in a country and the few at the top will get a huge percentage of that number. In the next 10 years there will not be jobs for most people but the more people the country has the more the poxy government will get thus keeping the rich in clover for the rest of their days while they continue to screw you. Its planned deliberate and its working for them not you.,2025-11-23T11:40:49Z,3

I have applied to the University of Essex for an MSc in Data Science, and only the UKVI interview is remaining.  I have a concern regarding job opportunities during my studies. As you have already mentioned, all cash-in-hand jobs are illegal in the UK. Therefore, I would like to know what kind of legal jobs are available for students during their MSc program.  Also, after completing my MSc, will I be allowed to do cash-in-hand jobs, such as working in restaurants, delivery services like Foodpanda, or anything similar — or even jobs related to my subject?  I would be truly grateful if you could share your thoughts and guidance on this matter. Your advice is always helpful and sincerely appreciated..",2025-07-29T10:26:51Z,0
