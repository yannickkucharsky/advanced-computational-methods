I - quite naively - thought this would keep up for at least a few years.   I still use the site these days, but no one can rely on it in the way you're describing here, especially in dense cities like NYC, LA, SF... if it's a general labor gig, you probably have under 10-20 minutes to respond before the job is taken, and even then, you're completing against dozens of people. Advertising your general services like you did is a complete waste of time when employers know they'll get hundreds of replies from desperate people. The number of people I've seen offering less than minimum wage for skilled labor is disgusting.",2019-07-21T02:39:10Z,178

BYfsQ-Tkpng,Top 5 mistakes to avoid when hiring an Auto Transport Company to Ship Your Car,We discuss the most common mistakes people make when hiring an auto transport company to haul their car across the country.,2019-11-14T19:28:30Z,@AutoTransportForDummies,"To all watching this video in August of 2022 or beyond :   Around the 8:00 mark where we discuss deposits  - Please understand we are describing the practices of a large % of the online slimy transport firms you will encounter out there. We are obviously not describing how we operate at https://airRyd.com - And the strategy described of ""waiting to pay a deposit until a truck is assigned to the order "" - simply no longer works because these large firms have adjusted, and they will often simply claim that a trucking company has been assigned, (even if they have not ) just to give justification to charge your card a nice $200-300 deposit fee. Then once your card has been charged, they'll update you a day or two later,  to let you know the ""supposed"" trucking company has unfortunately cancelled. But they now have you locked in all the same, and you have no way of ever knowing what's what. Some companies also even have shell trucking companies with real DOT #s on standby, with an actual person on the other end of the phone, just so they can claim they have dispatched out your order - so they can then charge your card. It is a tough world out there for the unknowing consumer.   At our firm, over at airRyd - we always have the same exact process on every single order. We charge a flat $89 (open transport order / per car ) or a flat $125 (enclosed transport order / per car ) on EVERY single order. It never changes. No games are ever played. Nothing beyond that is ever due until the delivery at the destination when your car is dropped off to you.  And if your asking, why charge an upfront fee ? We have a couple very clear answers to that question.   1.) If we charged nothing when a customer booked an order, we would have no possible way of knowing what orders are real, what orders are fake or spam, and we would have absolutely no way of knowing if this customer will be MIA or unresponsive once we do locate an option to get the car moved. This takes real human capital to deliver a good service, we can't possibly devote hundreds of hours to orders that simply are never happening. It is just a way to weed out those who are serious from those who are simply shopping.  2.) If we actually posted hundreds of ""non-confirmed "" orders on major load boards, including our own at airRyd.com - trucks will eventually realize when they inquire in on these loads, that at least 50% are not even legitimate. This will lead to a drop in activity from trucking companies, and thus make our real orders much harder to move. Trucks don't have time to waste, they want to deal with companies that have LEGITIMATE loads, not ""maybe"" loads. So this would lead to a damaged reputation for us on all major load boards.  3.) There is simply no incentive from our perspective to deliver a good service to a customer with a big question mark over their order, and there is also basically no trust from the customer perspective if they are not willing to pay a small fee to hire us. So the order is not on the right footing when no monies have been paid.  For these reasons and others, this is why we operate as we do. And if anyone is truly unhappy at anytime with our services, we will happily refund them on the booking fee , no questions asked.  To book an order with us today, please visit us online at https://airRyd.com  - or shoot us a text to our quote hotline at 913-215-3113  THANKS TO ALL !!! : )  Wes - with ATD",2022-08-16T17:05:48Z,12

During transport, the car was removed from transport and was driven over 100 miles. The car arrived 2 days late. He noticed a discrepancy in mileage, not only that there was a medium size dent in the passenger side door. When he contacted the company, they denied that any of this happened. He would have pursued filing a complaint but because of his job, he let it slide. Please if you have a problem with a auto transport company, don't let them get away with it.",2023-12-17T03:07:06Z,2

Use this guys service. I stumbled upon this video after getting very frustrated trying to get quotes from other auto transport brokers. I wanted to understand how not to get ripped off.  If your like me? And company reviews hold a lot of sway over your opinion? You’re probably experience and what I did. A lot of companies online have paid fake reviews at 5 stars, but then you find where the business is located and  their actual reviews and it’s more like two stars.   Anyways, after watching this video. I used the link in the description which got me over to his company website and Wes took great care of me and my vehicle moving from California to Idaho. The cost did come out a little higher than the original quote, but! The car was in inoperable and had no functional brakes, so very reasonable for the added complexity of the move.

And yet at my uni theres 1400 students! kinda messed up really huh. Oh and we don't have a NCLEX once we finish our degree we can get a job and get marked off all over again ugh!!!

I am pretty lost right now; I really have no idea what kind of job I wan to do and I am graduating in April!! But I went to my Uni's career counselor and realized that I am extremely creative and want a job with creativity and projects and I think that working for magazines, in advertising or as some sort of producer would be something that I enjoy.

You are probably tired of me saying that on Instagram!! Haha~~  My dream is to end up working for a Korean beauty industry but it is hard for me to get in since all the ones I know are located in New York and it is a burden as well as a risk since I just graduated with no experience in the industry for them to hire out of state since it is expensive on their end. My goal is to work for two years in Texas and save up money for New York. I might not be able to work in a Korean beauty industry here but maybe I can sell myself by my acquired experience and taking a lower salary! Hopefully someday my dream will come true but for now gaining as much experience in logistics as I can!!  I never worked in a startup before but I do love working for companies with less than 30 employees as you get to learn a lot! My cousin gave me the wisest words ever to do an internship for a corporate company and a small company. He assumed I would prefer the corporate one but nope, I fell in love with the company that only had 10 employees (including me) as I felt like I was a part of a family shaping myself into different job roles when needed. It was the best feeling ever, super thrilling! It was a challenging yet heartfelt experience at the same time. Even though the company changed industry and my role didn't exist anymore.. I am now working for a company with only 22 people and I am loving it just as much or maybe even more because now I have two main job titles!",2018-11-04T20:54:15Z,0

Sure it's better than most NBA coaches. Blatt for christs sakes He knows international basketball just as much as he knows the NBA. Blatt ain't European just so you know, he's Israeli-American. He didn't come to the Knicks just to be a consultant or scout He is much more than that. blatt is considered an offensive Mastermind in Europe I'm sure he can add something to this team I trust the process as long as Mills is not personally involved with ball operation going forward. We have to see his insights on things.",2019-12-20T06:32:49Z,0

I'm one of your subs that comment here and there but I remember watching one of your early vids when you was live streaming in SD and i think you were using the A6000. Anyways I remember being in them live chats with less than 30 people and here you are now. In my head I'm like ""yeah nobody know about this dude yet and he explaining and giving logical reasoning behind his fantasy facts"" so I thought it was cool watching you grow in the last year. Your channel is the only channel that I'm aware of that  goes in depth about the BTS and the culture of fantasy football business which I love because it shows the grind that really goes in to continue to do this.Anyways keep doing your thing.

IMO the way I do it blows it away just do .1 every yard and .04 every pass yard it’ll be the exact same only when ur player gets u 4 rushing yards for example usually u will get nothing till u gets 6 more yards my way u get 4 yards boom u get .4 points it will just add decimals to ur scoring but atleast ur getting credit for every yard ur player produced and also with decimals the chances of a tie is way less likely I hate it when I see someone 59 yards rushing and u don’t get credit for 9 yards when I switched to espn leagues at first they didn’t have this option I actually called them up multiple times and explained how .1 every yard was better and for the last 4 years it was been a option u can do and for anyone confused .04 pass yards is still 1 point every 25 passing yards .04 x25 =1 only when u get like 15 passing yards u will get credited .6 points,2019-08-04T06:19:46Z,0

The local SPLC office  was across the street. The mayor, Mitch Landrieu, Mary, Genie Oil board member, is his sister. Mayor Mitch visited the statue protest, uttered a prepared speech and the motorcycle gang, on cue, waved the Stars and Bars. The NYT and a few other MSM flagships, printed, or whatever it's called now, a story praising and glorifying Mitch as a hero and civil rights leader and made a big deal of being a brave giant for having the courage to face hatred, death threats and the angry flag wavers. All of this happened in New Orleans. What planet are these people from? One day, years ago, I was going to work and a neighborhood kid passed me  on his way to school. On the back of his jacket was a Confederate Flag. A big one. I asked him if he could wear that coat to school without catching flak. "" Why would anyone care about what I wear. Why what does it mean?"" I turned and continued to work. I didn't feel like talking that much.

I can't speak for America but growing up here in Europe during the 80s and 90s nobody cared for peoples particular skin pigmentation as it should be. And I hoped racism would soon be a thing of the past, boy was I wrong. Seems to me we are moving backwards in time almost, where nowadays your color is the most important thing about a human identity. I don't believe that is what early activists like Martin Luther King wanted, as far as I know he wanted race to be a non-issue , that's what we should strife towards! I also don't believe privilege and power have necessarily anything to do with racism. Racism is wrong no matter who is doing it to whom. But even if you were to make that case, Asians were never oppressed, in fact they earn more on average than white people in the US, they have a higher IQ and people like Jeong working on a New York Times Editor salary are most certainly not an oppressed group of people, just the opposite. This is plain and simple racism from a privileged and powerful person shitting on the little people.",2018-08-03T20:18:28Z,3
