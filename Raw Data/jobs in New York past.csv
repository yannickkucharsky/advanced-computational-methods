I - quite naively - thought this would keep up for at least a few years.   I still use the site these days, but no one can rely on it in the way you're describing here, especially in dense cities like NYC, LA, SF... if it's a general labor gig, you probably have under 10-20 minutes to respond before the job is taken, and even then, you're completing against dozens of people. Advertising your general services like you did is a complete waste of time when employers know they'll get hundreds of replies from desperate people. The number of people I've seen offering less than minimum wage for skilled labor is disgusting.",2019-07-21T02:39:10Z,178

As an ICU nurse for 10 years, I have had my share of threats, guns pulled on me, bomb threats, punches, pushes, etc. But I have also had my share of amazing and meaningful days. Days where I laugh, cry, save a life, help a suicidal patient, make a patient laugh who is depressed, joke around and most of all love my day.

My grandfather was in hospital for two months because of a big tumour in his throat. Yesterday he passed away from pneumonia at the age of 86. Anyways your right about the nurses. When he was in hospital he saw a doctor for about 15 minutes each morning. Everything else was nurses. Since this got so many likes I’m going to write some things I know the nurses did. Every time he clicked the call button they came, when he wanted to move from his chair to his bed they helped him, when he wanted to go to the bathroom they unhooked all his machines. They checked up on him hourly, cleaned out his tracheotomy, brought him for walks around the hospital which required two nurses, the did that even when their was no order from the doctors to do so. They also organized with the help of others for him to go home for a day. He loved it. I am forever thankful for those nurses at Muskoka Algonquin Health Centre.",2018-05-06T17:55:21Z,404

There’s financial drawbacks but here I go. I’m 33  UPDATE: I’m 32 tho 😂. Pursuing my passion has put me in a higher vibe which means I’m in more joy and I’ve attracted better things. Ironically on a lower salary from my usual job that I still have I am debt free and I have a savings account for the first time in my life. (I’m just attracting more abundance of everything good)   I am a writer. I started monetising my writing already and my first play is being produced. Im unstoppable now. Love you all and I believe in your dream as much as I do mine.

I've lived through corporate jobs with good money and striking out on my own, only to find myself crying in the middle of my living room because I didn't know how I'd pay the rent. It's easy to take for granted the things we have when we fantasize about something better. There is a financial reality we have to account for. Get a plan. Live below your means.

My dad was definitely a great man, but something I always wondered as I listened to my family and society is what was the point of it all? I see people wasting away, miserable at these things we're supposed to want, where they brag about having these overly expensive things. Then one day, I looked at my family, looked at their mindset and realized how I wanted none of it. I didn't want to waste my life doing a job, I didn't want or care about those nice things, I didn't give a damn about money, where the only reasons I pursued a paycheck was because it was a means to have a roof over my head and food.

It is riveting! Lisa is an outstanding writer for starters. I can think of a hundred adjectives and adverbs to describe the writing and retelling of her life and how her experiences shaped her. She doesn’t spare anyone, not even herself. Her family may be uncomfortable for things to be divulged, but Lisa is honest and fair. The light she sheds on her stepmother and aunt shows their care and generosity in how they treated her, especially as she was growing up. Sometimes things go awry. It’s clear she’s not trying to hurt anyone. They say they remember things differently. Of course they do. They are not her. They did not experience these things. Lisa did and she is telling her story as honestly as possible and has great insight in the telling. Bravo, Lisa!",2021-08-10T02:41:22Z,38

Thank you for your detailed and honest description of your first year as a stylist. I too am coming from corporate America 9-to-5 desk job which I felt my soul was leaving my body every time I walked into the door. Thing was 10 years ago, I was a make up artist for Sephora and Mac. I shortly after became a freelance makeup artist and even done New York City fashion week. But then I got discouraged and felt like I wasn’t good enough so I stopped and got a “grown-up” job. I’ve been miserable ever since. So I quit my corporate job, move back home to my fathers house and going to apply to cosmetology school in February. I was nervous about the decision and thinking about going back to the corporate job until I found your video. Your video encourage me to follow my dreams and not be afraid of failure.

Concentrate your efforts on getting the best continuing education you can afford and look for chances to move up to higher-scale salons as soon as you know you are good enough.  It's great that you have some negative thinking questioning your talent, because it is young women like you and like me 28 years ago that worry that they need to improve and thus do improve, while our competitors think they are good enough.  Let me also suggest that you learn how to be a ""Thairapist.""  I am not just a cosmetologist and master barber.  I also have certifications in hypnosis and NLP.  Clients come to me sometimes just to have me give them a relaxing, massaging shampoo, conditioning, and blowout just for the 30 minutes of thairapy I give them.

I discovered you last year, about the time I had just graduated High School. I started cosmetology school 2 weeks after graduation and found your videos so helpful! I love your personality and how you just get to the point and lay everything out the way it really is.   Now fast forward to Dec. 2020 I started my first stylist job at an Aveda concept salon. I've only been there a few weeks now, but I've been feeling so overwhelmed with my services. I haven't taken a real client yet, I've just been doing the models, but timing has always been a huge struggle for me. It stresses me out and I feel so discouraged a lot of the times. When you said that you felt like you were an awful stylist and questioning whether this industry was for you, I'm kind of at that point. Especially since I don't have any clientele at all right now. I'm so stressed about how I take so long on services and worried that I won't be able to fill up my books.  It's super nice to hear that you didn't get paid a whole bunch starting out and understanding that since I am at the same spot right now, that's what I should be expecting. Than seeing how much progress you made in just a year, gives me so much hope. I have that same ambition and drive that you do and you just helped me to stick with it.  I just want you to know how proud I am of you and how far you've come. I look up to you as one of my role models as a stylist. Being a stylist isn't easy on top of being a YouTuber, but if you can do it, than I can find my ways as well. Thank You for your channel and logging your cosmetology journey! Seriously, it helps me out so much and I know that it encourages so many others.",2020-12-12T01:27:41Z,1

Ich kommentiere nicht oft, sondern bin eher eine stille Zuschauerin, aber ich muss wirklich mal ein großes Lob loswerden! Ich habe noch vor zwei Jahren auch andere YouTuber geschaut, aber diese haben sich leider nicht viel weiterentwickelt. Deshalb passte es für mich nicht mehr und ich habe aufgehört, diese YouTuber zu sehen. Du dagegen hast dich entwickelt, deinen Kanal angepasst und so konnte ich mit dir „groß werden“. Deine Videos werden, zumindest aus meiner Sicht, immer besser, weil sie authentischer sind und du einfach deine Themen behandelst, die auch viele deiner Zuschauer betreffen, weil wir ja auch älter geworden sind.

Ich teile total deine Ansicht das man seiner Leidenschaft nachgehen soll, genau das habe ich letztens getan als ich mir für ein duales Studium im Bereich Mode entschieden habe. Ich hatte lange überlegt da ich ein sicheres Ausbildungsprogramm begonnen hatte bei einem grossen Unternehmen aber ich finde die Leidenschaft ist so viel wichtiger als immer nur Sicherheit oder mehr/viel Geld. Man sollte tun was einen erfüllt denn nur das macht einen glücklich und in den Sachen kann man sich wirklich entfalten!

Hätte dich fast deabboniert aber dann kamen Videos die mich tatsächlich interessieren. Ich glaube You Tuber “vergessen“ quasi dass ihre Zuschauer ja auch älter werden und nicht für immer 12/13 bleiben. Wenn der Content also immer gleich bleibt werden Zuschauer ab einem bestimmten Punkt die You Tuber deabbonieren. Klar kommen dafür immer wieder neue junge Zuschauer hinzu aber auch für solche ernsteren Themen gibt es Abnehmer die das nun mal lieber gucken als sowas wie “10 Anzeichen das er auf dich steht“ oder so....ich hoffe man kann verstehen wie ich das meine 😅😊,2018-09-08T07:45:53Z,0

Fand es damals schon fake und geldgeil/klickgeil, wenn ü20 Frauen zum 500. mal ein Backto School Video drehen oder über den ersten Liebeskummer. Scheint so als wären sie jetzt doch reif geworden oder nicht mehr so klickgeil. Und Diana finde manchmal merkt, dass bei dir noch, dass du dir unsicher bist bzgl deines Content, wenn du zB doch wieder irgendwelche Sommer Hacks zeigst, was du schon vor 3 Jahren gedreht hast nur mit anderen Produkten.    2. Irgendwie ist der Titel bisschen Clickbait, da man als Zuschauer erwartet, dass du erzählst was du nach deinem Studium planst oder sagst, ob du noch den Master machst, bist aber gar nicht darauf konkret eingegangen.  3. Hab diesen Frühjahr meinen Bachelor gemacht und das letzte Semester war mega stressig (Bachelorarbeit, 14-Credit- Klausur  und Praktikumsbericht). Dachte dann neeee kein Bock mehr aufs Studium, ich will endlich Geld verdienen. Jetzt arbeite ich und merke, dass ich doch lieber studieren will :D",2018-09-05T16:15:12Z,32

One: PSLF can be a great ROI but yeah her degree is a bit of an issue especially costing 115k.  Two: you are wrong on how the bank would look at her loan for a home. The payment is the payment. So when the dti is calculated it's based on the monthly payment not the whole debt like you stated. Third: I agree with you she is saving incorrectly. PSLF is calculated by AGI for the payment and this is done yearly. So she should be using the states retirement 401 k system tax deferred also using an HSA with HDHP. This creates less taxable income for the feds and the state of NY to grab at. Also could reduce he loan payment and allow her to stash cash during her 20's. Her current method is not to her advantage. Lastly, I do agree she needs to look at a home buying especially in NY where prices are dropping due to the SALT issue. Ok video but need to work on a few of the points. You did do some research but it's YouTube so you will have us sharpshooters.",2019-06-28T13:47:40Z,2

A college degree is just like any other commodity. When they’re giving them out they loose value and you have to go six figures in debt to make just above the average annual income. The fact that we the tax payers have insured these federal loans to 18 year olds that have no history of handling and paying back money is absolutely crazy. Of course there is a student lob crisis.

She meant that she has a lot of loans, but she doesn't pay a lot because she's on the forgiveness program. She's looking at it as being worth a couple grand a month, and she's not wrong until you look at lost opportunity for not getting into real estate and investing. And in her case, she's probably better off that way because she's not as financially responsible and savvy as she could be so she needs someone else to take care of the loan and take it off her plate, she needs the pension, and the automatic Roth contributions because she's not doing it herself. Between her and her partner, 70k a year plus partner's income should still be enough to buy real estate, if not in NY, in a different market nearby. (Just ask Samuel Leeds).

You can make a lot more than 12,000 per year more if you just apply yourself and stop trying to weasel your way out of paying for money you borrowed.  She's paying for it, she just doesn't get it.

For all we know, specifics can be anything from having like 6 roommates or housing may be subsidized (section 8/government grants), getting help from family, eating plain white rice or noodles every night, doing various odd jobs  and temp gigs to make ends meet until they FOUND a regular, steady job, selling things on ebay and the like, having less debt or expenses than the average Jane (no student loans, no car note, no kids expenses, etc.)....you name it.

For example, my rent is $1225 so my annual income needed to be at least $49k (or about $24 per hour). 3 times the rent refers to your monthly income, if your rent is 600 you need to be making at least 1800 per month.

My application fee was $50 my holding fee was $100 and I didn’t have a choice on the holding fee it takes the apartment 3-4 days to run a application + background check someone could come along and snatch the apartment in that time if I didn’t place the hold. Then my deposit was $1912 since I’m 22 with no credit history then  when you move in you also have to pay rent so just to move in I paid $3424 for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment. When I hear people complaining about their $100-500 deposit and $600 rent and then have the nerve to say they plan on moving to LA soon it’s like 😑🙄🤦🏾‍♀️,2019-06-07T22:39:46Z,2

As a assistant manger in retail I was only making $10hr and only allowed 40hr a week. Cashier is about $7.80-$9 hr.,2020-12-31T06:51:42Z,0

Mais quand on a une famille, une santé qui décline parce qu'on vieillit, des patrons qui culpabilisent ses employés en leur disant ""si tu ne veux pas faire d'heures sup ,tu es virée"" (je pense aux infirmières et aux aides soignants en France qui n'en peuvent plus car pas assez nombreux dans leurs services, épuisés, devant bâcler le côté humain de leur travail, et amenés à faire des bêtises car le mental ne suit plus, c'est abusé..) Nous ne demandons pas à naître, nous sommes sur Terre que pendant 75 ans en moyenne, est-ce que ce ne serait pas normal de tout faire pour être heureux le plus longtemps possible et ne rien regretter quand une fois vieux et malade, avoir l'impression que l'on s'est bousillé la santé et que l'on n'a profité de rien et qu'il est trop tard? Nous sommes 7 milliards d'habitants, de quoi se partager toutes les tâches afin de faire tourner ce monde, il me semble et donc avoir aussi du temps pour s'enrichir, en faisant du sport, se cultiver à travers toutes les formes d'art, voyager pour découvrir les autres et les merveilleux endroits de cette planète. En privilégiant la solidarité, le partage du temps de travail équitablement, ce monde irait beaucoup mieux... En tout cas, félicitations à toi, car tu fais ce que tu aimes et tu le fais bien et tu as l'air épanouie, donc tu es sur le bon chemin! Grosses bises!",2018-02-14T12:31:57Z,14

He’s an intelligent kid who graduated from Duke.   One good sign is that they didn’t quit on him.

But get an offensive coordinator who has more creativity cause you are right Shermur can groom jones. We only gave these coaches one year with shirt talent. But if we replace Nate solder with Trent Williams through free agency and pick up Isaiah Simmons as our money backer I feel wile will be in the playoffs next season.
