We are Mennonites so I started showing her your series on Amish and Mennonites.  She appreciates (as do I) your openness to the culture and how you respect all the people and places you visit.   I have enjoyed sitting with her watching your videos.  She has visited at least twelve countries and many cities in the US and this helps her recall some of her life that she usually can't remember.  She doesn't understand the concept of watching YT videos on smart tv's, so she is constantly asking if it is time for the show where 'that nice man' interviews people.

I returned home telling my mom that I wanted to move there. She said you won't be living like a tourist if you move there. A few years later a friend's daughter moved to NYC and after 5 years she left. She said 10-12 hours working 5 to 6 days a week plus your commute gets old. She also said no one smiles or speaks.

I visited Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Galveston. I’ll never set foot in Texas again if I can possibly help it. I knew a lot of people who moved there from the Bay Area would regret it. There just isn’t enough to do within easy access for enough of the year. In the Bay Area, you can take a day trip to go skiiing from December until March. You can sail or kayak or windsurf the rest of the year from scores of launches along the Bay and all along the Delta. You can comfortably hike year round, play tennis outdoors, bike in Golden Gate Park. In Dallas, I couldn’t do anything outdoors during the summertime. It was 90 degrees at night. I know Austin wasn’t any more comfortable. Stanford and Cal are two of the best universities in the world, creating a stimulating, invigorating environment. Unfortunately, Oakland has lost its professional sports franchises, but you still have the 49ers, Giants, Warriors, Sharks and Earthquakes, all the major sports. Austin? None of them. The food is better, world famous in San Francisco. More variety, fresh fruit and vegetables year round, pretty cheap too. There’s just no comparison in my mind. Sure real estate might have been cheaper, and probably still is, but I don’t want to stay indoors looking at the walls all day. More space just means more space to clean. A bigger garden means more weeds to pull. A riding lawn mower is not as much fun as a kayak. People severely misjudged what life in Texas is like.  So I’ll tell you. it sucks.

The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

But many of these equations don't factor in annual rent increases and how if someone locks in a fixed rate on a ""die here"" home at 4-5% they'll be paying the same monthly payment in 20 years whereas the renter may be paying double or triple the monthly payment. I'd love to see that factored into these scenarios since there's no way rates will continue to be at these current levels into perpetuity (and eventually landords turnover and start charging renters to cover the increased rates and values).",2025-05-19T20:09:05Z,19

The CA course, including Foundation, Intermediate, and Final levels, typically takes a minimum of 4.5 to 5 years to complete. This includes the required articleship training period of three years. Even for graduates entering through the direct entry route, the minimum duration is 4.5 years.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  Foundation Level: 6 months Intermediate Level: 8-10 months Articleship Training: 3 years Final Level: 6-12 months While some students might be able to accelerate their studies by studying intensely, passing exams quickly, and potentially completing the final level in one year after clearing the intermediate level, this would be an exception rather than the norm.

Aim to have enough, not excess. Learn to be content, not grinding. You will find happiness moment to moment, not in large clumps.

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment. Because in these jobs failure is not hard, but ""only"" results in a less satisfying customer experience, instead of a total production or process failure.",2025-08-13T18:22:00Z,916

But honestly, moving from NYC to the Midwest would do the same thing. Whether it's NYC Tech bros displacing midwest locals or Americans displacing SEA locals, gentrification works the same way, bringing higher purchasing power into lower cost markets. International moves just amplify it through currency strength, but the mechanism is identical.   And plenty of countries welcome expats who integrate respectfully, resentment builds when they form isolated bubbles and drive up costs. Preserving American culture isn't a priority for me personally. Different people value different things. Fixing systemic political problems takes decades with no guarantee of success. I'm not willing to sacrifice my life hoping things improve generations from now. Individual optimization makes more sense than betting on collective action.  If I do move internationally, I'm committed to doing it as ethically as possible. I'm learning the language, genuinely respect the culture and people, and love the food and lifestyle, it's not just about cheap living. I'm not planning to bring millions and live lavishly above locals, just enough to survive comfortably while working on my own businesses at my own pace. I want to integrate and contribute, not just extract value and live in an expat bubble.

Grew up absolutely fascinated with computers and technology, knew that I wanted to get into the IT field since I was maybe 13. Took about a year off after graduation just to breath, then went to a local technical school and took on the ensuing debt. Graduated 2023 and I have had exactly one actual in-field job not thanks to my education, but because of a previous connection I had. And unfortunately, that job didn't work out.  The worst part is I have friends who didn't go to higher education who aren't even hearing back from traditionally entry-level jobs like fast-food service. Higher education feels like a scam because of the amount of debt you go in and with no grantee that you'll get an in-field job. However, if you don't have a degree, you are completely screwed unless you have connections or get extremely lucky. I think it's so absurd that I, someone who is in debt, still living with my parents and barely motivated enough to get out of bed in the morning, am the lucky one among my friend group.",2025-10-21T15:51:53Z,48

In fact, they went up after the tariffs were announced and many cost of construction and building materials and basic consumer goods like groceries have also gone up reflecting the fact that inflation has increased during trump's entire term so far especially with the stupid blanket  tariffs. Can't understand why congress will not grow some  balls and  step in because only do you judicial branch is allowed to levi taxes against americans, which is what these tariffs are. Our gutless, Congress and system of checks and balances have failed us completely. We've let the President use executive orders to Create laws and run this country completely circumventing and making congress impotent. And our supreme court judges are so corrupt its disgusting. We have let our country descend into  a Cladimir Putin style dictatorship. Wake up America, you're being ripped off by Donald Trump again. He's using his position to make billions while he spins you over unless you take it up and you know what.  Especially the  a lot of Maga. Cult followers are too spineless, to admit they  were wrong for supporting Donald Trumps failing policies. Even though they know he's made so many huge failures, they are too gutless to admit it so they continue to support him. Just wondering what it's going to take 2 wake. America up may begin into a third world war, or watching americans get it locked in much greater numbers in concentration camps and rounded up like vladimir putin rounds up his citizens when they say bad things about the government?

Has the code been properly tested? If an AI was used to generate those tests, were the tests manually reviewed thoroughly? Ensuring that it didn’t make a suite full of garbage tests, just so that it can get close to a 100% pass rate. A multiplier of this makes work more challenging, not easy.  Is it maintainable? Did it make a bunch of unnecessary abstractions that make it difficult to understand? Again, a multiplier of this makes the work more challenging, not easy.  Did it generate code using outdated dependencies that have been subjected to numerous security issues? This multiplies the number of security risks, which again, makes the work more challenging.  I understand that the speed of delivery is important.

Whether LLMs or diffusion model or image/video generation, don't understand the world, they don't understand physics, they don't understand chemistry or biology.

Simple projects might see bigger gains, but enterprise software development involves much more than just writing code. It's worth noting that AI assistants are tools that augment human work rather than replace human judgment and expertise. They can speed up some tasks like boilerplate code generation or debugging, but they don't independently ""think"" or understand context the way humans do. They're pattern-matching systems that work best with clear instructions. The relationship between AI coding tools and business outcomes like sales isn't straightforward either. Even if developers write code faster, that doesn't automatically translate to more revenue—product-market fit, user experience, and business strategy still matter most. Better prompts definitely improve AI outputs, but they're not a magic solution. The quality of results still depends heavily on the problem's complexity, the human's expertise in reviewing and integrating the output, and realistic expectations about what these tools can and cannot do.",2025-10-27T11:26:17Z,5

Sure LLMs (and the following models) are going to involves layoffs, but in the 10 next years. The number of organisations who are *already* able to replace humans with AI is very very small. Today layoffs are more about a global crisis, with inflation, a US president disturbing the world economy, the invasion of Ukraine, climate warming (just the beginning...), etc. So sure, AI will take jobs, as robots did in factories decades ago, but it just means more time for other activities, at least with the proper political regime (not all for the already most wealthy).",2025-09-17T17:53:25Z,6

ATS systems have nothing to do with the impact ChatGPT and generative AI has on the labour market and it's not helpful to confuse the two. People have been complaining about ATS systems for a very long time, even before ChatGPT and the like existed.

Plus in many companies, high job positions are already filled by older generation of people who cannot afford to retire because this country has allowed large corporations to absorb pensions back to give CEOs the chance to give themselves bonuses, adding to their already inflated salaries.   So what are people going to do? I'm not surprised that this is happening. I'm definitely not gonna be surprised when the existence of the ""entry level"" positions would go away in the future. Since, companies doesn't want to give pensions to their retirement age employees, 20-something year olds taking entry level positions are gonna have to stay there almost indefinitely. Which is gonna cause a stop in hiring new employees, killing the future of the potential workforce that's coming up in less than a decade. It's already bad now. We have kids still in college & still in highschool who have less than 4 years left so that they'll be in the workforce too.  This is gonna cause a spike in homelessness, poverty related crimes etc. All because this country has continued to fail us over & over again. This is way worse than the Great Depression. This is gonna be something than this country hasn't seen before. Now since Donald Trump has fired the Head of The Department of Labor, actual statistics of what's happening & what's going to happen in the future will not be shown on paper.

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us. They are too busy competing to see who can burn it down the fastest.",2025-08-06T14:39:37Z,57

It cost too much to build stuff now.  Did you see that tariff freight on aluminum?  Did you see the recent price increase on steel?  Sure the steel is made in America now because all the other steel from across the world cost too much but the American steel companies are driving up prices because they have a barrier of protection now. They know what it would cost to get steel from a foreign country and they literally raise their prices until they’re just below that point.  Guess what that’s way more than what American auto makers were paying for steel just months ago.  The price to manufacture parts has simply gone up.  If you’re receiving raw material from overseas, your price has gone up and profit margins are slim for automotive suppliers. You can’t make a profit. You gotta lay people off.  Sometimes you have to close the doors.  We have seen that in the metro Detroit area suppliers literally saying we’re closing the doors. We can’t make money anymore. These tariffs are costing us too much.  It’s stupid because the tariffs aren’t even protecting the auto makers. The auto makers are complaining about the tariffs.  They are broad tariffs that hurt our automakers more than they actually hurt foreign auto makers. It’s not like Donald Trump is saying I’m going to put a tariff on these vehicles as opposed to our vehicles although he is doing that he’s putting a tariff on all raw material which we used to make vehicles driving up our prices.  It’s stupid and people are gonna suffer for it.  The sad thing is, he’s going to turn and blame others for his poor economic policies and say it’s their fault the economy is falling apart.

The federal government has purposefully crashed the economy to forestall entitlement reforms, tax reform, immigration reform, and industrial policy reform. Any reforms would risk uprooting entrenched financial positions so they’re crashing the economy instead. AI should be a boon for productivity but that can only happen during economic growth periods. So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life. By the end of 2028 there will be a full blown economic depression similar to 2008, or perhaps even worse.",2025-10-02T22:40:01Z,13

This was a minimum wage job, yet they treated it like Amazon warehouse where they keep pushing you every day you work to be faster and do more in less time.  I was written up for the dumbest stuff.  One night I was stocking I had 4 mixed pallets on one end of my aisle and 1 pallet of just my stuff at the other.  Management called me to the office and said they're writing me up for not working because that 1 pallet is still sitting there at the end of my aisle.  I explained he obviously didn't see the other 4 mixed pallets which my stuff on top buried everyone else's stuff underneath so I was trying to move that off and stock it because you're not supposed to leave boxes strewn across the floor.  Management said they didn't see it and apologized, but said they still had to write me up because they had already called me to the office and it would look bad on them for pulling me away from my work for nothing.  That was back in 2015.  I'm sure Walmart is a lot harder today.  I changed jobs went to a grocery store doing minimum wage.  The grocery store refused to provide benefits, so everyone was scheduled less than 20hrs/wk.  I had just graduated from college (in my 30s) and had 10 years of customer service/retail exp under my belt and they treat me like I'm below the high school kids they were hiring that sit around drinking gatorade and playing on their phones.  Anyway, minimum wage jobs for the past 10 years couldn't afford an apartment, and I'm sure nowadays they can't either.  My old apartment up near the university was across the street from the grocery store used to be $600/month.  Today, it's practically doubled in rent, and the neighborhood now has a lot of problems with drugs.  A nice apartment in that university town you're looking at paying $3k+ for a single.  I left to China in 2019 because I couldn't find a job with my BA degree from the university right there in that town.  The Career Center at the university kept telling me to apply for GEICO insurance because they just opened new offices and needed help.  Her husband worked there.  I applied and went through round 1 of interviews 3 times.  They always ghost me after that.  So one day I called GEICO and asked to speak with the HR because I really wanted to know yes or no whether I got the job.  They told me the HR will be working on Thursdays.  I called back on Thursday, and the HR was out of town down in Florida on a family vacation.  I'm sitting there like, ""you could have told me she was going to be out of the office this thursday, call back next thursday, but you didn't.""  Felt like they just were making up stories and the job postings on Indeed might have been fake to appear like they're hiring when they were not.  I was also upset with the career center for not helping me find work.  You would think the school would be helping graduates find work because it'd show that their university degrees actually have value!  Instead, they didn't help me.  I had to go out and find my own job teaching in China.  I wish I could end there, but covid started 6 months after I arrived.  Their visa situation was chaos and my visa expired during a lockdown, so I couldn't get another work visa and I had to return home.  Now I'm jobless, living at home, taking care of my grandmother that was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  If she goes into a nursing home, we'll lose the house.  I've tried finding work when I came home from China, but employers just laugh me out the door.  The only type of job hiring right now is heavy industrial, and I don't have any heavy industrial skills.  I'm an academic, not a tradesman.  You say the job market is on the edge?  I'd say it's already collapsed when even young generation are struggling to find entry level positions and salaries everywhere are not keeping up with inflation and the rising cost of living.",2025-09-02T05:00:45Z,93

We got hit with two back to back hurricanes last year that were horrendous (Helene and Milton). Lots of flooding in Tampa and surrounding counties. People can’t afford the insane property taxes and insurance rates, that’s assuming you can even get insured. Homes are no longer “cheap” and rents are sky high. Car insurance is some of the highest in the country. The main issue with Florida is that we are up there in the top costliest states to live in yet, the salaries here are amongst the worst. The COL is insane compared to the salaries. If all of that sounds good, plus, hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning that kills every year, crazy traffic, overcrowding, extreme heat/humidity for most of the year, no seasonal changes, tense political climate, bugs, gators, venomous everything, etc…I could go on…then yes, by all means, move to Tampa 😂 Signed- someone who’s unfortunately lived here for over 40 years.",2025-07-11T16:23:12Z,40

That was due to someone writing graffiti on one of the high schools' walls, they had the picture and everything.

When I was offered a chance to take a job here 26 years ago, I told my wife ""Why would we want to move to Buffalo?"". She's a Detroit girl, so she was all about it. Then I met the people, saw the nature, experienced the culture, and found a home. We love it here. We own an old house in the Elmwood Village part of the city within walking distance of pretty much everything we need. Until I retired a few years ago I rode my bike to work. As for the winters, we joined a year round hiking challenge a few years ago, and winter has become the best time of year to be outside. Some storms can be brutal, so it pays to be prepared and to never take the weather for granted. And, yes you need a car - an all wheel drive is preferable. We live on Subaru Street. Finally, my son and daughter-in-law lived in the Albany area for years, and we always combined visits with hiking the Adirondacks. It’s a great area too.",2025-06-06T13:26:59Z,315

But after moving to the U.S., I fell in love with the Northeast. The beauty here—the changing seasons, rolling hills, meadows, lakes, and creeks—completely won me over. What’s not to love?  I know winters can be tough, especially for the elderly who might not have support, but aside from that, I don’t see many downsides to living in this region. I’ve heard plenty of people complain about the cold and gloomy winters after moving away, but honestly, I’ve never seen it as a problem. I actually love the winter scenery—bare trees, quiet landscapes, and that peaceful, frozen stillness.  To me, constant heat all year round feels monotonous. I enjoy watching the vibrant colors of fall, feeling cozy by the woodstove while snow falls outside, seeing flowers bloom in spring, and hearing crickets as summer approaches. Those small, seasonal moments are things I never got to experience back in the tropics, and I truly cherish them now.  What also makes the Northeast special is its close proximity to major cities like New York City and Boston, along with an abundance of top-tier universities and colleges. This attracts a diverse, young crowd and helps drive innovation, culture, and the economy. Add to that the region’s rich supply of fresh water—something that’s becoming more valuable every year—and it really feels like the best of both worlds.",2025-06-07T18:06:27Z,278

I began visiting childhood friends in the southern Adirondacks in 1980 and fell in love with the area. I bought my home, a small cottage built in 1936, at a tax foreclosure auction for $12,100 in 2000 (you aren't going to get a deal like that now). I purchased additional land next to me a couple of years later. Mind you, I have lived in only 2 apartments during my 55 years in Brooklyn, this is the only that I have ever bought. The town I live in has just under 800 residents, but that population more than doubles come the summer. We are rural, no municipal water, gas or sewer. If you're rich you heat with electric, otherwise we heat with wood, propane, oil, coal or wood pellets. Most heat with wood, like me. Winters are BRUTAL, but I knew that before I bought the house. I moved up full time in the Spring of 2013. Public transportation sucks for sure. I don't drive, so it's a taxi down the mountain to the shopping areas and doctors in the county. It's great that Walmart delivers, but if I want stuff from other grocery stores then it's a taxi or a friend to drive me. Doctors are issue, we do have a small hospital in the county as well as adjoining counties but most of the clinics associated with the hospitals have NP's or PA's. If you need to see a specialist, you could wait upwards of 2 months for an appointment. Property and school taxes are OUT OF CONTROL. New York State mandates are roughly half or more of the property tax. Medicaid is the biggest mandate along with Welfare and another listed as ""Other"". Counties must pay 25% of mandated Medicaid and Welfare programs in their county. The more you hand out; the more property owners have to pay. You do get a break on school taxes if your property is your primary residence and if you are 65+ you get a much bigger break. But depending on the size of the school district (number of schools) and whether or not they are union schools, the school tax can be very big. I am surrounded by forested land, which I like, but living in a rural area does come with certain dangers like falling trees and wildlife that wants to have you for its next meal. Bear, coyotes, bobcats, and fox are common here. A few days ago, I looked out my kitchen window into my yard and some something strange. When I went outside, there were the carcasses of 2 turkeys and feathers all over the place. I do not leave the house without my Glock. Lots of people have been posting photos on Facebook of bear and coyotes that their security cameras have captured. We do have crime in the town. Mostly burglaries fueled by drug addiction. Lots of overdoses, some fatal every month. Well-paying jobs are hard to find, if you are lucky to get a state or federal job then you will get paid well. Local and county jobs pair a fair wage but not as much as the state or feds. All in all, this is a much better life than what I had in Brooklyn. Here I can set up a target in my back yard and do some target practice and nobody will complain. If I hear gunshots, I don't have to dive on the floor and get away from the windows. Politically, the town is Conservative with Republicans outnumbering Democrats 9-1. The county is predominately Republican with one location being more Democrats and that is the area that has the most problems. Before you decide to move upstate you really have to do your homework. I have seen, since the pandemic, people buying homes (overpriced) and moving up here only to decide to sell and move out after a year or two. Winters are brutal, this isn't NYC or Long Island. Residents shoot guns and hunt. The pizza SUCKS. If you want gluten free you are not going to find it here. If you are Left in your political beliefs, you are outnumbered. If that bothers you buy a place in the overpriced Catskills.",2025-06-13T09:59:02Z,6

Fifth generation upstate New Yorker. Family moved to Mid Atlantic region when Dad got out of the service in the late 50s. He took a DOD job, Mom stayed home with 7 kids. Mid Atlantic was a great move for Dad and the family with all of the opportunities. We always vacationed every summer back to NY State and when I got married in the late 70s my wife and then our family continued to vacation and visit family in the Upstate Region. About 20 years ago I rediscovered the North Country and we spent a lot of time there. As we got close to retirement we started looking for a second/ vacation home in the region for the summer months. Home prices were extremely reasonable even Lake and Riverfront homes. Unfortunately the multiple taxes that come with home ownership are utterly ridiculous for what little you see in return. My taxes on a million dollar home in the Mid Atlantic are high vs the national average but nowhere near as high as the areas we looked at.  We were looking at roughly the same taxes on a 400K home in the N Country. So instead of buying we rent for three summer months on the St Lawrence for what we would spend on taxes if we bought. Makes no sense to me.",2025-06-01T13:30:17Z,9

It's also nice to be close to NYC, Boston, and Montreal, if you want to catch a show or get a taste of a big city. As for when I lived in NC, definitely a better place for younger people and more job opportunities, but unless you golf, go to church, or are a college basketball fan, you might find it rather boring and dull and the summers were pretty brutal with the heat. Everyone goes to the beach on the weekends, which is a 2-hour drive, but do I miss it, not really. SoCal is definitely materialistic and way too expensive for my taste.

Economy is GIGA cooked and a lot of people still haven't caught on just how much. ""Unemployment"" only counts the people who ""qualify"" as being unemployed. If we use 1970s numbers (do you have a job or not) the unemployment rate is actually 25%. Gen Z alone is 41%. And AI is just beginning to seep into mainstream. Not to mention the H1Bs and illegals working under the table. The Great Depression had unemployment rates of 21%. Housing is a private equity bubble. Global demographics are a ticking time bomb. The dollar and the monetary system built on it is a giant Ponzi scheme backed by debt which itself backed by leveraged debt backed by US government bonds which are backed by the 'strength' of the US economy. Since the inception of the Federal Reserve, the dollar has lost 96% of its value. Only 4% remains until it is worth nothing.

Half are definitely ghost listings, I eventually picked up work at a small art gallery in NYC, then finally landed a spot at a tech startup. I thought things were turning around, but it was the same story everywhere. Every place I worked found a way to squeeze more out of me while paying less. Long hours, weekends, holidays; none of it mattered. And when it was convenient, they let me go. I only lasted 6 months at the tech startup, laid off due to AI.  At some point I just hit a wall. I figured if I was going to work this hard, it should be for something I actually care about. So I walked away from the mess and went all-in on aviation. Now I’m in flight school, working toward becoming a commercial pilot. Airlines at least offer real protections, solid benefits, and a career path that isn’t built on constant undercutting.

It just says how many people, who are eligible for unemployment benefits, are actually receiving unemployment. If you quit your job (due to a toxic work environment), did not seek unemployment, gave up certifying for unemployment, your unemployment ran out, or otherwise didn’t qualify for unemployment / currently on unemployment but are still an adult before the retirement age who isn’t currently working, you aren’t counted towards the unemployment rate. That said, even if we assume that rate is twice as high (like 8% the eligible working population) which is overly generous, the point in the video still stands, but that would help explain why (1) it’s hard to get a job and (2) the perception of others without jobs being fairly high.  2) The unemployment cycle is extremely real. In addition to what’s mentioned in the video head hunters and job recruiters extremely favor those who are currently working than those who aren’t. They often assume that those who are unemployed lost their job because they’re incompetent, or not good to work with, and that they’re currently unemployed because they’re lazy. Furthermore, the longer you’re unemployed, the bigger the gap in your resume is making you easier to pass over by recruiters. Do what he says in the video and everything you do while unemployed in terms of training and self development, put it in your resume to fill the gap. It makes you look like you weren’t sitting on your thumbs just waiting for the next job to fall into your lap.  3) You can do everything right and still be unemployed for 6 months - 1.5 years. It sucks, but you have to remember it’s a numbers game and that this is ultimately a matter of luck (in essentially being in the right place at the right time). All you can do is increase your odds (and this video does do a good job at telling you how to do that), but be aware that you aren’t alone, and others have been in this situation you’re in or are currently going through it themselves. As he says, just keep at it (it’s all you can do at the end of the day anyway).",2025-05-16T13:42:55Z,704

For that statistic you would rather take youth (16-24) unemployment rate, that consists of high school/student graduates. The youth unemployment rate is 9.7%, which have grown almost percent since the last month. Especially the AI growth have played huge difference in the IT industry, where companies don't need to hire young candidates, cause the easy task can be done by AI. The market has also been over-saturated of IT students/workers and it will only be harder for them to get into IT. I've been a specialist in certain IT field for 2 years, got my job eliminated in company and couldn't find a job similiar to that for half a year.

It is very true that online job boards are in a bad state right now. Fake job listings, thousands of applicants, and companies using ai to deny resumes, not to mention having to make online accounts for every company that uses workday among other pains that you are no doubt aware of. But I assure you in the sea of thousands of job listings there is one out there for you. I recently secured a job with a company that uses workday after months of applying and almost calling it quits. I know how bad the struggle is but you should never stop applying. But most importantly don’t just apply to every job you think is a good fit for you. Make sure your resume and cv are tweaked so hr or the hiring manager can understand what you could bring to the job.",2025-05-16T22:43:05Z,27

It can involve individuals blaming individuals, individuals blaming groups, groups blaming individuals, or groups blaming groups. This practice can be a way to release tension or frustration by directing negative emotions towards an innocent party.  Here's a more detailed explanation: Deflection of blame: Scapegoating shifts the focus away from the actual cause of a problem, often to an individual or group that is perceived as vulnerable or different.  Release of tension: It can be a way for individuals or groups to release pent-up anger, frustration, or anxiety by projecting it onto the scapegoat.  Social phenomenon: Scapegoating can be a social phenomenon where a group targets an individual or another group to blame for their problems, sometimes to maintain power structures or reinforce group identity.  Examples: Scapegoating can be seen in various contexts, from families where one child is blamed for all the household issues, to larger social groups blaming minority groups for economic problems.  Consequences: Scapegoating can lead to prejudice, discrimination, and even violence against the targeted individual or group.",2025-06-27T00:10:58Z,0

NOW you know that people like her are NOT lying and this is NOT a damn myth! It's been reality for years.

Instead of telling us ""little people"" to repeatedly fix and update skills, resumes, cover letters, curriculum histories, interviewing techniques, our looks, and all that stuff when we ALREADY do, the ""bigger guys"" need stop being picky! Entry/junior level jobs used to only require a high school diploma and no experience. Now for the SAME jobs, they want years of experience with or without a degree. But that's not how it's supposed to be! Entry level is supposed to be for college students, new graduates, low income people like us bettering ourselves, people with no work experience, and for people changing careers. Those positions are NOT supposed to be for experienced workers! Only intermediate and professional level jobs are for the experienced!     They cannot it have it both ways: They tell people to ""go get a job,"" ""you should work like the rest of us,"" and ""don't rely on taxpayers for welfare."" But, they are the ones who don't want to hire the same people and that's why those same people have to get on and be on welfare. Plus, if we want to restore dignity in merit and hard work again, then the nepotism, favoritism, sororities, fraternities, insides ties, and country club ties ALSO need to stop!!!! AND EDIT: Stop the outsourcing of jobs too. Don't get into more wars that ruin the economy, don't create more recessions that ruin the country, and don't let inflation get sky high.

A few thoughts on the systemic issues Joe and Tracy touched on: • The Tariff Trade-off: We need to stop looking at tariffs just as ""revenue."" The real danger isn't whether they fund the government, but how they act as a wrench in the gears of the global supply chain. If they make it harder to move goods, they create a ""scarcity inflation"" that hits consumers regardless of what the federal deficit looks like. • AI vs. Infrastructure: The scale of the AI buildout is staggering, but as noted at, it’s a massive drain on our power grid. We have to ask: is it a good use of our nation's limited energy and top-tier engineering talent to fuel a ""circular money machine"" that mostly generates ""slop"", while our physical infrastructure and climate goals are sidelined? • Solving the Vibe-cession: The disconnect between ""good data"" and ""bad feelings"" comes down to precarity. Even when the economy is ""growing,"" people are terrified of the ""life-ruining"" event of losing a job. We don't just need growth; we need a baseline of economic security that doesn't disappear the moment a tech bubble pops. • The Goal of the Economy: We’ve moved from an economy that builds things to one that functions as a ""comparison engine"".

This does not represent the average persons income. Investments are overwhelmingly owned by and benefiting the wealthy - particularly after taxes. Investment income has a much lower capital gains tax rate of 0 to 20%. However a regular wage earners has a much higher federal income tax rate of up to 37% as well as state (0 - 13.2%) and local income taxes (0 - 3.88%), Medicare taxes (1.45 - 2.35%), social security taxes (6.2%). None of these impact investment income. The lack of significant investment income has greatly depressed actual and perceived income for anyone depending on a paycheck or even a social security check. This is the reason consumer sentiment has taken a nose dive. FRED's personal disposable income value does not represent most Americans actual income. You can't explain the divergence between these two charts because they have little correlation to each other - especially if one is a low income earner with no investments, such as 40% of Americans according to a 2025 Gallup Poll.",2025-12-29T22:19:08Z,3

What's going to happen is actually far more predictable than you think. If we assume business as usual and no major economic reforms we can expect: Increased wealth inequality, increased asset inflation, Corporate consolidation, Private Equity and Shadow Banking prevalence increasing, further disconnect between financial markets and the real economy, trajectory towards a Super Star economy (Two tier economy), increased Zombification, Artificially suppressed interest rates, trends toward stagflation, atomization and alienation, relative deprivation and increased social instability.  The list goes on and on. It's starting to get tiring how people who follow neoclassical economic doctrine act surprised saying no one could've predicted what we're seeing today. The overall trajectory has been going this way for over 40 years and it especially supercharged after 2008.

I've also decided that I will no longer subject myself to being treated like a commodity at a cattle auction. In the end, all of this is designed to make you accept doing more for less. I think at some point we give in and accept unrealistic things because the ""market demands it,"" or the influencer you follow or the group of followers in the bubble you're in dictates that this is the culture, technology, or method to be adopted. Yes, I went through a financial setback and had to accept working in other segments. But that didn't kill my desire to work with software. Today, I think the path is to work as an entrepreneur and consultant for small businesses, creating solutions for the region you live in or where you can work without creating a burden on your life.

The most important point they bring up is that many companies plan to use AI to take more and more tasks away from humans. ​But the worry shouldn't just be about ""losing your job."" The real problem is the value of your work. ​A good salary was always safe because your skill was rare (hard to find). Now, AI makes that skill easy to find (abundant). What the machine does for free is worth very little when you do it. ​This is why your profession is going through Wage Compression. ​The solution is not just ""using AI"" to be faster. The solution is to pick a side in the market's new rule: ​The Machine's Boss: You tell the AI what it must do and what the goal is. You control the system. ​The Machine's Worker: You only do what the AI orders, like the example of the surgeon who becomes the machine's ""steady hand"". ​If you only follow the machine's orders, your value drops a lot. Your safety is in being the Boss.",2025-11-04T14:46:29Z,13

Perhaps the two questions I am still struggling with are; a) While we do AGI and innovation, and our search for better science and better AI continues, is there a need for a global ethical framework that govern it, if the AGI is not a replacement for human beings (human workforce), but supplementing and complementing human endeavors? b) As young people (and increasingly children below 12 years) are mostly using AI engagement models through games and Chatbots and social media, how is it going to affect the human minds, and new generations in terms of the science fictions and delusions in most cases, their minds are trained using AGI?",2025-11-17T05:27:40Z,5

In fact, coding is just like the electrician example she used. The faults are hidden, plausible, and hard to find. There is no verification system right now - especially not the AI ones - that can find them all. And if testing does reveal a fault in outputs, finding where it resides (and working out how to fix it) are time consuming. For more specific detail, check out the MERT study on productivity harm using Claude - and note how even though coders thought they were more productive using generated code, they were less productive than similar coders not using the LLM.",2025-10-29T13:47:22Z,11

It seems Professor Chen has also adopted certain American manners. His opening remarks about Dr Jeffrey Sachs struck me as unnecessarily dismissive, particularly given Dr Sachs’s stature as both guest and world-renowned statesman.   Academic courtesy demands deference to invited speakers, especially one who has contributed so deeply to global development discourse. The tone at the outset reflected more of an American talk-show sparring style than the civility one expects of a university platform.  It was, in that sense, a disappointing moment for HKU Business School — but an unqualified triumph for Dr Sachs, whose measured and eloquent address reminded the audience of China’s extraordinary civilisational continuity and the constructive possibilities of its future.",2025-11-03T07:10:16Z,3
