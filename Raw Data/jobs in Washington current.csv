I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt. But, that is just a dream.",2025-05-24T14:52:11Z,67

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting.. So I think that I would never regret studying it, in fact I'm doing a master degree in Accounting atm, and I'm planning on pursue the CPA position.",2025-09-30T09:11:25Z,6

The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot""",2025-08-04T21:15:27Z,1410

So when the national average was 15% unemployed, the actual number was more like 30%.  This wasn't necessarily due to malice, but at least due to artifacts and methodological issues in how the data was generated.  ADP can only see a small portion of the US job market, and while they can model outwards, their modeling has always been insufficient.  Add in the fact that there's never been a metric able to account for ""underemployment,"" and you begin to see the real inefficiencies.  The best metric today is to consider that the historical benchmark for judging whether or not a household is ""middle class,"" is that your yearly gross household income should be equivalent to the current market value of your home.

Yes food costs more but that’s not the only factor. It costs more because wait staff makes more. And then add a forced minimum tip of 20% on top of that, it’s just not doable anymore. Blame the President all you want… but this started under Biden. The only difference between then and now is that the illegals that were exploited by these businesses are no longer there. The total and tip has been the same for years, but the businesses no longer have employees to work for half the price of a citizen or someone with working papers that are afforded the same rights and protections under the law. Food being made at restaurants is no longer good so why pay huge money for substandard food and service. But these places get away with it because they take advantage of the person who doesn’t feel like cooking. My son works at a restaurant as a cook. We warned him years ago that he needs to find a new line of work. Preferably in the trades. But he didn’t listen.

The tax passed but was repealed after Amazon threatened to leave Seattle. Seattle's 2025 Payroll Tax: Seattle recently passed a payroll expense tax on individual compensation exceeding $1 million. This tax was proposed by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and was later approved by voters. It is intended to fund permanently affordable housing. Other Seattle Tax Proposals: Seattle is currently debating other tax proposals, including a measure to rebalance the Business and Occupation (B&O) tax to lower taxes for many small businesses while raising revenue from larger companies. Additionally, the city council recently approved a proposal to increase the city's sales tax to fund public safety programs. “",2025-11-01T19:02:36Z,0

At first glance, this may seem like a compassionate use of government power. After all, who could argue against caring for the poor and needy by providing them with food, shelter, medical care, and their other needs? Isn’t it for the common good? The problem is that to accomplish this goal, socialist governments must take someone else’s money or property away before they can give it to the poor. Here’s the moral problem with this approach. If I take something that is not mine, especially if I take it by using or threatening force, that’s still stealing. Why don’t we consider it stealing when the government takes something from us by threat of force? Just because the taking is done by the government or with the approval of the collective, that doesn’t make it any less of a matter of stealing. There’s also the matter of how each of us has different interests that drive how we live and the decisions we make. This is part of human nature and it does not work well with coercion. Unfortunately, socialism requires coercion in order to accomplish its goals. Governments that embrace socialism will target the most productive members of their societies as a source of revenue or property to fund its programs. Inevitably, this leads to wasted resources and a powerful motivation not to be too successful, so as not to draw government attention. This results in shortages and even more poverty than before. People who might have wanted to build businesses and to create wealth and opportunity will think twice before doing so if they stand a good chance of getting fleeced for their efforts. This is why socialism has a very long record of failure wherever it has been tried.",2025-12-02T17:00:42Z,20

It took twice as much of the CORRECT ROCK, and a few extra months, to finish the job. Just to cover THE WRONG ROCK on the road surface.

Tarrifs are a tax on tbe people.  Manufacturers raise prices to cover the tarrifs, and retailers raise the tax on goods to cover the higher price they paid.  The tariffs only hurt all businesses and cost the consumer more.  Trump thought that the manufacturers would build factories in America to avoid paying a tarrif.  I'm not sure Trump really thought this through.   Trump thought that to avoid the tarrifs, the manufacturers would build factories in the United States. The tariffs that the manufacturers are not paying anyway are way  less expensive  than to build and run a factory in the United States.  If these manufacturers already have a factory and the cheap labor to work it why would they scrap that to build a factory that would cost lots more to build and then have to pay employees almost tripple or more than they already are?  If the factories were built in the United States, prices for everything would still go up, and the American people would still be screwed.  Also, to build a factory and get it running takes years, and they already have factories with cheap labor.  Besides all that Trumps tarrifs were deemed illigal since Congress is the only ones that can impose them and only in certain circumstances can Congress give the president authority to impose tarrifs.  The bottom line to all this is that now we have to wait for the Supreme Court to listen to Trumps appeal and make a final decision.  Trump is no good for America or the world and needs to be stopped.  There have been many, upon many lawsuits against Trump and his administration, and even though Trump and his administration lost most of them, where are the repercussions, and why the hell isn't Trump in prison for his crimes?",2025-09-05T02:51:59Z,0

Physical, social, emotional and so on.
