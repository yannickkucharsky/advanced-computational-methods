I started to work in warehouse jobs and I wondered to myself how this British family men make a living with this shitty salary. They don't, they worked full time and they had to claim benefits. I am a migrant but I understand many people want brexit because it is impossible for them to make a living even if they work 7 days per week. I understand their desire of cutting off the flow of migrants getting into the country but brexit has not been a solution. Not for the moment. Workforce is scarcely so it is expensive. Jobs which were paid 9p per hour are now paid much higher. Part of the inflation we are suffering comes from that. If companies have to pay higher salaries, products and services will be more expensive. I think university in the UK should be more affordable for the people. In Spain, normally your family will do everything to pay your education which is cheaper than the UK. My impression is that the vast majority of Spanish community after 2 or 3 years they have good jobs and the main reason for that is  university degrees.",2022-08-13T10:17:50Z,10

A perpetual labour surplus maintained by open borders; is the most basic and obvious reason why wages are driven down and the cost of living is driven up. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you increase the competition for a limited supply of jobs, for a limited supply of housing, you bid down the value of labour and up the price of a home.  Latest house building figures is 170k houses were built in the year ending June 2019, that doesn't even cover Net immigration; never mind those also born here... and we wonder why housing is so expensive, even with central bank rates at historical lows?  It's something so obvious that immigration is often rated one of the big issues leading up to votes and elections, because everyone can see this. It is also something that is not the normal and can be traced back to Tony Blair's policies, it is not normal for hundreds of thousands to be piling into the country every year. All of which need to be housed, employed and provided with NHS care.  Yet because of ideological subversion, it's been made into something you are not allowed to question. Businesses like their state subsidised minimum wage labour and anyone who threatens that, they'll set the useful idiots on the Left to scream racist at you.",2020-09-12T20:41:00Z,5

It stops people from working, because their productivity is less than the minimum wage, the end result is they are not employed, unless the money is donated via charity to train and upskill them. People who know nothing and can do nothing need to start somewhere. I'm sure there would be plenty more apprenticeships if the minimum wage was scrapped.  the minimum wage has effectively sawn off the bottom rungs of the economic ladder.  The nominal value of a wage is irrelevant, its the costs of production that counts. When productivity is increased, say bread became 30p, everyone benefits. Food, housing and energy needs to be cheap, or everyone suffers  purchasing power comes from productivity, not the nominal value of a wage.

3zljtr24g4I,Why UK Wages Are So Low,"Wages and salaries for many people in the UK are RIDICULOUSLY low. This completely sucks, but why is that? It seems that ...",2019-04-04T17:00:00Z,@tc9634,"The UK is a very high wage economy especially at the lower end. Employment is at its highest on record and unemployment is at its lowest on record meanwhile inflation is also super low. Ex-pat intake currently doubles the population growth rate from 0.25-0.5% but on aggregate that adds to the GDP growth rate by at least 0.25% - we can pick and choose which ex-pats to take but not who's born here. Universities are our centres of science, innovaton, research and development - economic growth comes from them! A significent number of ex-pats come here on Tier 1 visas - literally coming here to invest (all too often in propert speculation but hey-ho) - and Tier 2 visas - an employer is so desperate to find someone they're prepared to go through all that hassle to hire them from overseas! We have one of the best education systems in the world, people have always complained about the things you complain about but edcuation hasn't changed much for the last 100 years and you are somewhat overexeggeratin/straw manning with that argument. Most benefits go to people who are working to help out the lowest paid, prevent poverty, and reduce inequality (yes, inequality is bad, it causes civil unrest, price instability, excludes the ""other half"", doesn't help democracy). Warrenn Buffett is very pro-this sort of thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6irBmOnQEc) because it's fair. Even though it seems wrong that effectively low wage paying employers are being subsidised by the state, you could also see the welfare state as a way of redistributing wealth from the most profitable and stable sectors of the economy to perhaps less profitable and stable sectors - this helps keeps the economy diverse and prevents us ""losing"" workers and businesses to poverty when recession or inflation hit. This also keeps people in work and occupied and at the very least prevents idolness. For example, Thatcher (love or hate her) did destroy the industires that many towns across the North and Midlands depended on - entire commuinities were plunged into worklessness, idolness, and all the problems that go with that ever since. It is cheaper and easier to subsidise, at least while those towns find ways to replace old industrial jobs, than to try and undo the damage of a town losing its livlihood. These industries did not deserve to die simply because times were tough (i.e. double digit inflation). The UK should stand for more than profits. The welfare state also makes it easier for start-ups and SMEs, by making staff cheaper for them (at the expense of perhaps larger, more established, more profitable, more stable businesses and sectors). SMEs, everything from your local newsagents to a company like Swizzels or Iceland or Gym Shark, account for 99% of businesses and more than half of GDP, and they are where the real innovation and growth come from. Most jobs that have been ""lost"" have been lost to the higher inflation of the 70s and 80s, and to technology - NOT to ex-pat intake or globalisation. It is difficult, expensive, and far more risky to move jobs abroad - it is a last resort. No-one knows what skills are going to be needed 10 years in future. The arguments you mentioned about education have been going on for CENTURIES (Einstein made some similar remarks) - it's now new, don't worry, education is better than none (example: all human history). Lower taxes do not, and never have encouraged start-ups (although not having stupid anti-landlord taxes would be nice). People will start businesses and thrive regardless of the tax rate - if it's the same for everyone the economy will rebalance and adjust accordingly. Taxes are actually very low and very easy to manage compared to the US and Europe, we're a very business friendly country (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/ease-of-doing-business). i.e. in the US there's an entire industry of tax advisors, in the UK we don't need that. We also have the NHS so no-one can't afford healthcare and everyone can live and work and save and spend and invest and rent longer.   I think what the economy really needs is: 1. less outsourcing of services, not so much offshoring, rather, stop paying businesses to do jobs instead of hiring someone to do it 2. less managers 3. MUCH more affordable housing   I agree that too many students are being conned into wasting 3 years of their youth destroying their future (university). I agree about point 4 as per my ramble above. I agree that the UK is ""over"" globalised - 76% of FTSE 100 earnings coming from overseas vs 44% for the S&P 500 in the US. It's wonderful that we are this global centre of business, but I don't likw how dependent on trade we are. I would like to see government focus on the domestic economy rather than going on about Brexit, trade deals and exporting - we export plenty we just happen to import a bit more because we're a developed modern consumerist 80% service economy that can only supply 60% of our food needs.   I don't agree that these problems are specific to the UK. The US has all of these problems but much, much worse (https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_gordon_the_death_of_innovation_the_end_of_growth?language=en). University is seen as ""normal"" whereas in the UK it's only 40% who go, huge student debt (UK student loans system isn't a loan it's an extra tax), huge high school dropout rate compared with UK (we don't really have one), huge crime rate compared to UK (in spite of recent heardlines we're as peaceful and safe as Europe and Japan), higher inequality, even more foreign property speculation.   *my points about ex-pat intake are ON AGGREGATE, yes, by ex-pat intake I mean immigration   I'm done :)   - this is intended to be a healthy disagreement/debate",2019-04-04T21:35:30Z,7

UK salaries are higher only by eastern european countries, Spain and Portugal. USA, most of European countries and all of the developed Asian countries offer better salaries than the UK. The reason behind the supply in Civil Enginnering positions in the UK is because the new generation of British will not put the effort to study a ""difficult"" subject such as Civil Engineering to get such a low pay when they can spent less time and energy studying a subject which offers double and triple the salary.   I really cannot understand why nobody talks about the low salaries in the Civil Engineering industry in the UK. Only people that love the profession continue in this industry. The new trend in the industry are the apprentiships. Students that could't achieve proper marks during their A levels they enter the industry via apprentiship schemes. That has surpress the salaries even more, companies have junior-student engineers for 5 years with the minimum wage.  You may get a good experience in the UK and the unemployment rate in this field is very low but the profession is dead and obsolete. There are no inovative engineering solutions and even now in 2020 softwares in the Civil Engineering industry are so out of date. In addition, the application of inovative solutions, new trends and technology is not existing in the industry, you will only find it in academia and research.

Welcome to the 'hospitality' world, where you slave for rich people, serve meals that cost more than your weekly wage and BARELY sleep. It is not rewarding in any single way. Poor guy is young and naive.   I've worked in a hotel in London and I have never met a single british person working there for 1 full year.

Highest paid jobs are given to Russell's graduates and foreign students find it difficult because our universities are not as famous as those, besides we are expected to have a high proficiency in English, which is an extra effort.
