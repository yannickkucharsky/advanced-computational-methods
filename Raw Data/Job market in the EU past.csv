Welcome to the 'hospitality' world, where you slave for rich people, serve meals that cost more than your weekly wage and BARELY sleep. It is not rewarding in any single way. Poor guy is young and naive.   I've worked in a hotel in London and I have never met a single british person working there for 1 full year. I have not moved out of the UK because of brexit, but the terrible weather and superficial people. Good luck with your economy after Brexit.",2020-09-08T15:49:39Z,0

The specialist in the field  very eager to give their expert opinion on how to mitigate the threat of “technological unemployment”. Instead, what we most importantly  need today is, a historical perspective, clear scientific approach and futuristic vision to understand this issue. IF THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN THE A.I. TECHNOLOGICAL SITUATION CONTINUES, IT WILL RENDER THE HUMAN LABOR OBSOLETE, SOONER THAN LATER.  Here I totally agree with the humanoid  robot Sophia. We should not fear about the AI robots destroying the world. In fact, the rapid technological progress in the robot automation provides the great historical opportunity that the humankind has been waiting since the beginning.  To liberate themselves from the  drudgery of human labor. The SERVITUDE, enslavement, humiliation that the  majority of the population compelled to undergo by the minority in order to earn their living i.e. wages, salaries or income. Now, with the progress in the AI technology  we can  gradually get rid and finally  abolish the human labor for wage system and replace it with an equitable income sharing system. It can begin with the  “unconditional” guaranteed income system one may call it the Universal Basic Income or the UBI.  My book titled “An Alternative to Marxian Scientific Socialism: The Theory Reduction in Working Hours (RWH); ….” Published in the year 1981. Today I rename it as Zero Work Theory (ZWT) More of its details in the  links bit.ly/2mGAUWg  , http://bit.ly/2eARyEx http://bit.ly/2nR4MAP  The principle behind the ZWT is that the fruits of the progress in the  science and technological in the human society  should not be appropriated or accumulated by only  a few  but it is their historical responsibility and every people concerned, to see to it that the benefit should be equally shared among all members of the society.",2018-04-24T02:56:23Z,0
