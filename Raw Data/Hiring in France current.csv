This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

For larger firms, this is worse than contacting recruiter directly.

Especially these days where applicant to role ratios are wack. Chances are they already have dozens of folks contacting them directly.

We started out using a relocation service and were not satisfied.  We ended up doing it ourselves with the help of expats that were very helpful with advice and steps.  The biggest revelation for us was that we did not have to be skillful in French to get things done.  We found the apartment, set up the bank account and arranged phone and internet service ourselves with little problem.  In all cases we attempted to converse in French but they generally would converse in English.  The representative at Credit Agricole amazingly apologized for her poor English.  The biggest takeaway is that fear should not control the decision and there are many expats that can help without charging you.

I think it is also similar of how if you really desperately need a car and go to a car dealership then you know they are going to take advantage of the situation and your options are limited. My advice with everything including relocation is to take your time. Perhaps visit more than once, spend a month or two each time. Learn the language. Meet others. Explore. Also learn and figure the process. Don't pressure yourself. Lastly leave the path open to come back if things don't work out. The tldr is to be flexible and take your time.",2025-05-17T01:23:37Z,10

I moved to France earlier this month as a single retiree. I didn't need an immigration attorney to help me apply for my long-stay visa. That's a couple of thousand dollars or more saved. However, I did use a housing search consultant while still living in the US. That was money well spent because the renter/landlord relationship, required paperwork and requirement of a guarantor are processes so different from what we're used to. Plus I calculated I would save money by not paying for a long-term rental in France while apartment hunting. The leasing agent set up my electric utility and the search consultant helped me set up a bank account as part of their fee. I did the cell/Internet service myself.",2025-05-19T04:57:46Z,7

(There is one I know in the nearby village from you).  If you look on Internet, you will find mostly stories about things that went wrong. When someone has no problem, he will not document about it. When I was looking to make my visa, all I found was negative. And my processing had been seamless. I took the time to comment about it, but it is uncommon. So be careful about all the  negative experiences you can read about.  If you are about to relocate, it is because you have strong motivations, changing continent is not something you do on a whim. So it should beat the anguish about the paperwork.  The modern tools, Internet, automatic translation, make it really easy to work out the problems yourself. If not, maybe you are not made to live abroad.",2025-05-17T03:35:08Z,4

I saw the videos from a certain company where they interviewed some past customers. There were pink flags, but I did correspond with them about getting a visa. I did not want a zoom interview (we have lived a public life and I do not want to be on a zoom call). I arranged for an initial phone call. It was scheduled for 8.30 a.m. US Central time. I was ready and waiting at the appointed hour.... I waited.....waited for an hour. I contacted the person who was meant to be my agent. He gave me another appoinment three weeks away. (Was he really that busy?). The same thing happened .I was ready and waiting.... I contacted him and he said he was sorry we had missed each other again. No he missed/messed up.  It was then that I thought the fancy videos were false and decided to try, by myself. to get a visa. Their videos are very 'fetching' , but the unkempt people on their site might be your first clue that all is not well. Thanks for warning about these sharks. Americans particularly are nervous about a foreign country and need someone to advise... but not at the huge prices that these agencies charge.  It is possible that i was not going to be a lucrative customer as I have owned a house in France since 2002 , I have all the things one needs to live there and we have spent a lot of time in France for many, many years, so perhaps they wouldn't make much profit on my account.

Be careful: even if you're highly paid, you will usually need a guarantor unless you can present at least your last three payslips. And of course, you'll need proof that the guarantor is financially capable of covering the rent if you can’t. Some landlords even ask to see your income tax documents—technically illegal, but it’s often a case of “comply or miss out.”  When moving in, make sure the handover certificate (état des lieux) is filled out completely and accurately. If you sign for 10 holes in the kitchen tiles instead of the actual 11, you’ll likely be charged for repairs.  When moving out, don’t accept any “NV” (meaning “not verified”) entries in the final handover certificate. This is often used as a loophole to claim damages later. At the very least, it can delay the return of your deposit (usually the equivalent of three months' rent). They may even deduct indemnities for imaginary damages—illegal, but who has the time and money to fight over 100 or 200 euros?",2025-05-16T20:42:41Z,3

On the other side they can have very little requirements if they're desperately looking for a renter (landlords pay taxes - ""taxe foncière"" - even for an empty property).

We are starting our planning to make a tax resident move in 2 years. Our first goal will be to get a solid understanding of the rental real estate market - we will focus our search from Cannes up to Ville Franche. Blind Google searches can be frustrating.  Can you recommend a reliable/accurate website(s) for rentals?  We prefer unfurnished and are open to committing to a multi-year lease with a healthy budget. Thank you!,2025-05-25T19:05:20Z,0

Ways to not look or sound American don't tell everyone you see your American don't speak English with a heavy American accent like a southern draw Y'all is a dead give away, learn at less to say hello in French if not a lot of French it helps! Don't talk about how much you have if possible your as poor as a church mouse, if ask can you get a car your answer will not why yes I can, no it is I don't know what do I need and why a car! Learn to ask questions to any question ask of you don't answer until you have to which is almost never the first time your asked get them to repeat the question in another way look stupid act stupid it helps because you are stupid because your clueless to what you about to do! The number one rule of France is there are no rules there are guild lines often called rules! We don't want you over there we want you somewhere here somewhere near kind of close by that means maybe or maybe not we don't know yet we are looking into it even with a lawyer the law is not black and white until they tell you it is now a done deal on paper until then it stands as a maybe it may depend on you asking the right question to make a done deal that helps you sometimes it fall on your shoulders not the government when is that no one knows because there is no law one way or the other and you must push over and again it is not understood until you ask them the key is why always ask why and do it 100 times if you can because never hurts if your politely ask, so it is yes sir but why is that sir! Don't forget the SIR it will make or break your deal if you leave out even if by accident even if your mad use SIR even in English best in French but why is that sir said in French is like giving him gold!He may actually let you do the impossible that is not illegal just impossible yes there is a big gap of difference between the two! You must always ask please sir! EDIT If here lies to and you have prove bite your lip and still use sir because by doing that he looks more guilty that just guilty and with the yes sir ask you still have a chance with him to get what you need no your not likely going to court because we don't that he we make feel stupid by say sir that is the best you can hope for which often works but if it don't that does not mean you can't ask later again often you can this is France we ask until we turn blue in the face!
