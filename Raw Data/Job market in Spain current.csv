Thats because there dumb and haven't prepared a sufficient CV for the recruiting company in their college.   My case I cracked 20LPA package from Dshaw. Working for past 2 yrs about to switch companies aboard. So it isn't about which institution you're doing from. You must have skills and lot of projects prepared in your CV, obviously you also need to know which companies come to that college.   IIMs have sliver lining that you will get a decent package even if you don't try hard as someone from tier 2. But in the long run the harder worker will get more opportunities than IIMs in my experience just because your CV is way more detailed and seasoned compared to their only complishment being couple coursera and IIM recognized degree.",2025-08-21T16:11:33Z,15

Average salaries are very low, especially compared to the cost of living. A net salary of €1,500 per month is considered ""good"" even for qualified positions requiring a master's degree. Yet, rent alone chews up more than half of that. The age of financial independence is around 35 years old, which is insane. It's almost impossible for people under 40 to buy property without financial support from their families.  Spain is losing more and more qualified jobs in favor of tourism-linked ones, which are very volatile. There's almost no industry or innovation, and scientific progress is practically zero. It's sad to say, but our economy relies heavily on young, drunk British tourists.  And let's not forget, the number of government workers is growing, which doesn't improve the economy. There's zero entrepreneurial spirit; everyone wants to work in administration to land a secure, easy job where they cannot be fired. No government (right or left) is trying to address these issues.",2025-02-04T13:24:23Z,1756

In a nutshell, the macroeconomy is doing well, but the microeconomy is struggling.  On the macroeconomic side, we have positive indicators: strong GDP growth, rising exports, a booming tourism sector, and decreasing unemployment rates. We also have the good fortune of receiving migration from Latin America, which shares both our language and much of our culture. This has allowed for smoother social integration compared to other countries where migration often generates more social conflict. In fact, migration to Spain from non-Latin American regions tends to present greater challenges.  However, on the microeconomic front, things are more challenging. Wages often do not match the rising cost of living, particularly affecting younger generations. Housing prices and rental costs have skyrocketed, making access to affordable housing increasingly difficult.  That’s the big picture from here—thank you for the insightful video!",2025-02-06T18:05:46Z,40

Spain is a hugely popular country to move to so basically remote workers are flocking to the country, bringing in wealth, purchasing and paying taxes. I’m a recruiter in a tech company that is fully remote and the majority of my hires in Spain - people from rest of Europe that recently moved to Spain or planning to move to the country. Moving to Spain was popular before COVID but at that time job opportunities for foreigners (without the knowledge of Spanish) was fairly limited outside of Madrid and Barcelona. With the power of remote work, people can easily get a job, live in a cheap region of Spain and enjoy life.",2025-02-03T19:50:38Z,13

The majority of spaniards report their economic situation to be worse, and the problem gets bigger if we focus on young and working classes. So Spain isn’t actually outperforming Europe",2025-02-05T13:19:17Z,16

This news is false, and I'm going to explain why.  GDP growth driven by employment rather than productivity  GDP can grow either through increased employment or higher productivity. In Spain, growth has been more reliant on job creation rather than productivity improvement.  The expansion of GDP since 2019 is largely due to the increase in employment among foreign workers.  Of the 1.75 million new jobs created in the last five years, only 388,000 went to Spaniards, while 1.35 million were taken by foreigners. Virtually all GDP growth has been captured by foreign workers. Real incomes of Spaniards have remained stagnant since 2019.  Although the overall economy is advancing, the well-being of native citizens has not significantly improved. Growth benefits immigrants, but many Spaniards remain in the same economic situation as five years ago.",2025-02-05T10:38:27Z,15

Although GDP may be growing, the cost of living is rising insanely quickly. Spain used to have a very low cost of living, and therefore not very high salaries. Salaries have stayed the same, but the cost of living has gone up exponentially. Living in Madrid or Barcelona is as expensive if not more than in places like London, but salaries are much lower.  Also, a lot of people have said this, but the government is cheating a lot on its reporting of the economy. Many definitions have been changed, such as that for ""employed"" people (if you work a seasonal job 3 months a year you are now classified as fully employed), and in general the INE has come under a lot of scrutiny because its overblowing most statistics. Keep in mind, even with these wrong statistics unemployment is completely unsustainable. You also have a bunch of large companies which bring in a lot of wealth leaving the country (i.e: Ferrovial).  I get that this is simply a macro analysis of the Spanish economy, and thats fine. I just feel that its worth to mention that this huge growth is occurring within the context of a hugely inefficient government. The weird thing about this economic growth is that it somehow manages to happen while businesses are being stifled and living standards are getting worse.",2025-02-03T19:49:36Z,16

Imagine that a loaf of bread costs 0.80 in Switzerland and 1.20 in Spain ""for example"", but in Switzerland the average salary is 3,000 and in Spain 1,200... the difference is greater if you divide the price in each country by the salary and compare it. Even if a loaf of bread in Switzerland were worth 2 euros and in Spain 1, it would still be favorable to Switzerland, since it is 2 times the price of the product compensated by a salary 3 times higher (this is a crude example)
 
 Another factor is the low accessibility to housing...prices increase, confidence in the security of ""house raider"" homes, or the increase in taxes despite the fact that salaries do not rise to the same level, is worrying. We see a worsening in many public services, we see an increase in taxes, but we do not see an improvement at street level in our lifestyle...Less purchasing power, lower salaries, higher taxes, concern about pensions, lack of police resources to combat crime and bad inmigration ""In fact, 2 police officers who did not have adequate vehicles or bulletproof vests have died fighting drug trafficking"", superfluous expenses in infrastructure, problems with the road and highway network are very noticeable. Many of these factors are not reflected in the study and are elements that, although they do not reflect the performance of an economy, do reflect the impact of the economy on our lifestyles.
 
 On the other hand, if the per capita income is higher, it is only on paper, since we do not appreciate that there is a direct relationship between that indicator and the consumption capacity of our pockets...in other words, it is like saying that if there are two fried chickens, and only two people, statistically we have both eaten a chicken. The reality is that this year there are 2 chickens, but we continue eating half a chicken each.

Even though the economy has grown, the vast majority of people haven’t seen an improvement in their purchasing power due to rising prices. Even if your salary had increased at the same rate as inflation (which is usually not the case), the fact that income taxes haven’t been adjusted for inflation means you actually end up with less purchasing power.  Additionally, we’ve experienced a higher cumulative inflation for last years that hasn’t been reflected in wage increases. On top of that, some macroeconomic data is distorted due to changes in how it's calculated. For example, unemployment figures don’t include temporary workers who aren’t currently employed, nor do they account for actual hours worked (as there are more part-time jobs).  Lastly, inflation statistics don’t fully reflect the significant rise in housing costs, which has had a major impact on people's financial situation.",2025-02-24T16:25:38Z,47

I have in excels all my monthly expenses for all these years, and i have been reducing my expenses. Five years ago, i bought one bottle of wine weekly, expensive spices, went to restaurants 2-3 times a month, eat my breakfast in coffes every working day... all of that, I stopped spending in it, and my monthly expenses went from 400 to 600 euros...  Another example is how all services are become worst: public health, public education, public transport... mostly due to insane increases in burocracy  Last year too, I'm from valencia. Do you remember the DANA? Well, there are still many places which have not recuperated from it. In the town I'm living the train still doesn't work, but the roads are clear. I have friends living in other places who are not so lucky, and they themselves had to rehabilitate a road to be able to move. A great amount of industry and business has been severely afected by it too.

I November 2021 m2 of a flat in Madrid costed 3,6k€. In February 2025 it's at 5,1k€. That's 41% increase in 40 months. As an example - a bank will tell you that you earn little (when asking for a mortgage loan) if it's below net 2,5k€/month. I earn a good bit below that and still a salary comparison tool will tell me that I'm in the top quintil of salaries in Spain. Which is to say if your normal wage is below 2,5k and a m2 of a flat is 5,1k, and you're aiming for at least 50m2 one, it will be worth 9-10 years of your salaries, so effectively 30 years, considering you shouldn't spend over 30% of your salary on your flat. That's why many people leave Madrid now.  For instance, flat I'm paying for now had its value rise 30% in last 20 months and it's a working class district, with little new development so far.",2025-02-25T11:27:01Z,7

On top of that, real estate especulation is a factor that none of these rankings take into account, and as it happens in the US, renting prices are through the roof due to tourism especulation. Considering Spain is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Europe, and our economy depends big time on it, this effect quickly spread throughout the cities, forcing the working class out of the city centers. Some people in the comments wrongly point to demand and offer, as it always happens when this topic arises, but companies like Airbnb have completely changed the real state market, and thus we need to change the way we analize it. Sure, goverment needs to do something about it, but that's exactly the reason why we strongly believe our economy is not advancing as much as they tell us. Inflation doesn't help either, and even as the minimum wages have risen way higher than inflation rates, it still has a negative impact in people's minds when surveyed about the economy.

That's one thing that is hardly talked about, and it seems to be the most important indicator, because in rents and mortages is where you put the greatest chunk of your monthly income. If you're paying lets say... more than 33% of your income just for the housing (rent or mortage), then it is a lot. Places like the big cities of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona,...), along with the coastline towns have seen a huge jump in housing prices because we have a lot of people coming from all over Europe with high wages that buy houses and help the house prices to rise, also creating a big pressure in the housing market. Maybe that's one of the most important issues with the people's discontent. If people are losing economic power due to a sharp increase in the cost of living, how can it be said that the country's economy is improving? 🤔",2025-02-26T10:31:56Z,2

Our purchasing power has barely recovered since 2008 after inflation, and well, you can see the effects on the graph you posted about the ""feelings"" on the Spanish economy.  Then there was the recent inflationary crisis, which has affected Spanish families a lot. And this has a severe impact on our perception of the economy, similarly to how it happened in the US. For instance, prices of some foods have gone up like 50% or more. Sure, ""technically"" this is not a big deal because this was only a small part of our expenses, but seeing the high prices every time you go to the supermarket will affect your vision of the economy. Salaries have also increased but, well, everyone expects their salary to increase with time.  A third thing, partially related, is the housing crisis. Another global phenomenon, but it has hit some areas in Spain hard, plus, with Spanish families coming from a worse position (compared to, say, Dutch families) they are struggling a lot more to cope with the rent increases.  Like you mentioned, again, this was a good year, but what is a 3% increase to a median family. Supposing even that small percentage change affected them when you account for inflation and all, it really is barely noticeable. It's just one year, we might be the best performing economy in how we improved, but unless we see this go on for 4+ years, I don't think the ""feelings"" about the economy will change much.  Lastly, the fact that a large part of the change was driven by immigration is also a concern. NOT about immigration itself (that's another topic) but about the sustainability of the growth. We have one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe, which makes our pension system one of the least sustainable in the continent. Immigration was particularly high due to political/economic troubles in Argentina and Venezuela, for instance, but this won't go on forever. Many people who want to leave those countries due to the recent troubles already left, and while a constant trickle of immigration from Latin America is expected to continue, the immigration rate may go down to previous levels, stifling the economic growth (and worsening our struggles with an aging population).  So, yes, we had a great year. But it was just a year. If it continues, which is a big ""if"", Spain might earn the right to call itself the ""best"" economy in the world, but I will hold my enthusiasm.",2025-02-22T15:30:34Z,38

Nowadays there is no big difference between Spainish prices and Finland, Germany or France. But indeed there is a strong difference in terms of salaries.  There are many others indicators that make you feel bad about the Spanish economy: average age of cars in Spain is the second higher in Europe, bad job market, high rent prices, no industry and big dependance of turism, most of the qualified jobs are offered in big cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, ...).

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0

In my dept they let go 6 people. I'm just lucky they didn't do it by seniority..... But I also feel so bad. One manager who has worked for them for TEN YEARS was let go. And yet the school president and other higher ups are making way above the national avg for the jobs they have.

The common theory is help desk is a starting place, and networking, sys admin, and cyber security are their own specialties and expecting more than a vague basic understanding of the other fields isn't needed to start.   I am very interested in why you think that is wrong, and why the rest of the industry is not expecting and paying for the knowledge base you're arguing for.  Because your chart puts cyber security at a 6-10+ year senior IT role that should be starting pay in the 6 digits.

You should have thousands of different resume versions.  Have it collect data for what specific versions get responses.  Have the AI automatically apply and spam those resumes to MILLIONS of job postings and boards.  When you track which ones finally get responses, you can have AI analyze the data collected.  Then have that go into an evolutionary algorithm to increase fitness to the resume versions that actually generated responses.  After a few thousand generations, your AI should have finely tuned optimal resume versions that generate tons of responses.  Now, for the interview and whiteboard problems, this is where google glass comes in.  There's way to generate 'gray"" references and experience too.  Also there shouldn't be ANY particular tech stack, framework, or toolchain out there that you DON'T claim to be an absolute EXPERT in.  AI can help you through faking it till you make it.

When I pressed him for clarification as my background is not in software engineering but rather security engineering, he clarified that even though they call it a coding challenge but it’s more of a pentest/vulnerability assessment of a web app.  My thoughts were like yours, you can’t do a full assessment in the 30 minutes allotted for that part of the interview.  It turns out that the assessment was more like a CTF, sniffing around a test web app looking for a hidden directory, break a weak password, and grab the text file.

There are about 1.2 million software engineers working in the U.S. That number hasn’t really changed much over the last decade. So despite all the layoffs, it’s not that software engineering is going away—the jobs are still here. What’s actually changing is who’s holding those jobs.  Right now, there are roughly 600,000 active H1B visa holders working across 50,000 companies in the U.S. About two-thirds of them are in tech, mostly in software engineering. That means around 400,000 of the 1.2 million software engineers in this country are H1B workers.  Now, the cap on new H1B visas is 85,000 per year, but there’s no cap on renewals. So while domestic engineers are getting laid off or locked out of entry-level roles, the number of active H1B engineers just keeps growing.  If you do the math, over the past 8 to 10 years, about 4 to 5 percent of the domestic software workforce has been replaced each year. But that percentage is getting worse. With so many layoffs and people leaving the field, there are maybe 800,000 American engineers left. So if 55,000 new H1Bs are still coming in each year, that’s more like 7 to 8 percent of what's left being replaced annually.  Take Microsoft for example. They’ve gone through multiple rounds of layoffs this year, but also applied for over 6,000 new H1B slots. That’s not unusual either—tons of companies are doing the same.  Now, my opinion: The H1B program was supposed to be a way to bring over highly specialized talent in cases where the U.S. was lacking. It was never meant to be a tool for replacing domestic professionals with cheap labor. But that’s exactly how it’s being used.  And we’re seeing the results. Code quality is dropping. Technical debt is piling up. Onboarding is slower, product velocity is declining, and morale is shot. Engineers, both domestic and foreign, are burning out. The whole thing is starting to feel like a bubble. And at some point, it’s going to pop.",2025-07-05T21:55:47Z,2

I came across your channel yesterday, I really appreciate you detailed explanation regarding this visa type. I am based in Germany but we would like to try this visa for my sister based in Cameroon. She graduated with a bachelors degree from a university in cameroon.  Regarding the proof of funds Meaning if I create an account for her with 8000 euro we can use that to apply. Reason is I find it safer to put money in an account in europe not in cameroon so that I can desolve the account and have my money back if she is not granted the visa. Is it possible to visit other EU countries with this visa type or one is not allowed to visit any other country. I learnt having a job in spain can be very difficult as preference is given to spanish people do you think she can have a job as a graduate in clinical psychology? Is it worth trying?. The proof of funds if it is 7200 euro will not be an issue I can give her 8000 euro, I think it is possible to create an account like a block account in spain by a german citizen should not be a problem. What do you think?   Thanks and kingd regards",2025-08-02T11:19:12Z,0
