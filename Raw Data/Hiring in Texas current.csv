Several cars had skidded off the road right in front of us, and were driving so slow. Eventually some kindly trucker pulled up next to us and gestured for us to follow him with his lights. He led us to an off-ramp where we were able to find and get a hotel. After getting us safely to the off ramp, he went straight back on the road. He probably saved our life that night. An driverless truck would’ve just left us to wreck and freeze — probably would’ve caused the wreck by failing to account for the conditions.

I was local, but I was hardly ever home. The company I worked for decided to expand from a small one covering three states to covering the 13 western.

Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

Many view it as stupid, but was very fun/easy to understand while many couldn't do the critical Philosophy classes. I thought as a kid, ""getting/doing Computer Science/IT will help A LOT for my future"", looks like that's not the case. The job market sucks and cannot find a job.

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

Pretty much every study ever done shows people are more productive when working from home, but they can’t control you when you’re at home, and they _hate_ it. Theoretically, as long as you’re performing well, getting your work done and hitting goals, they should be happy. But employees who work from home can almost always do that and still do stuff like… run errands, take a shower, hell, get laid. Companies don’t like that. They want to own you. If you have second job, their control over your income source and health insurance goes away. They don’t like that. They’ll fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening.

So he started looking for other jobs and now he is actually working his full-time job making 80k a year that he picked up another full-time job that he does simultaneously making 90k a year and he works with me doing larger plumbing installs. Making one to 3K a week. That's a lot of money but the real trick is he pays for his cars in cash and he lives in a tiny little house on 17 acres that only costs him $700 a month. So no car payment. Makes over 200 Grand a year and doesn't even spend $10,000 a year on bills And no kids. Me and him are going to split hydro excavation truck. They are $200,000 and can dig a 1 ftx1-ft hole straight down 15 ft through all kinds of underground gas pipes and fiber optic wires. 200 Grand but you get $400 an hour for the truck and an operator.

I've read a lot of comments about senior command staff being the biggest problem. I totally agree. The world thinks so much of police, but they have no idea what it is really like. They have no idea what people will do to each other to get promoted,  to get that special detail, to get that detective position. People would always say to me, ""you guys don't get paid enough..."" You are correct. But not for the reasons you think. I carried a gun, wore body armor and was trained to deal with all sorts of threats from domestic encounters, three hundred pound drunks, meth heads and active shooters. But there is no armor, no training that can protect you from a weaponized administration. The world would be shocked at the things I have seen.  But now I have a nice job and get a check every month from my department's retirement that reminds me that I don't have those problems any more.   All the best, young lady.

The rest of the time, I wouldn't even get calls for an hour or more and could just fart around on my phone while answering the occasional email. It was a great lazy girl job.

It's okay to be lazy, especially when it comes to phone call jobs.  I've been working from home for 21 years, and the 3 companies I did phone work for, were so mentally draining. The calls were b2b and nonstop my entire shift. I don't mind steady calls, but not nonstop calls. I would love to get at least a minute breather between calls. Therefore, I would work evenings and weekends. So,  can you please provide the name of the remote job you're booking the appointments for?",2025-09-23T21:07:53Z,1

Employers can't even be bothered to read resumes anymore and have you manually fill it out for no reason other than to make it easier for their AI to weed out so they dont have to do anything. Sometimes they even make you take a 20 minute test about what kind of worker you are and you still never hear back. Makes it so disheartening and feel like it's not even worth applying... and can't go in person to apply anymore either. They just tell you to apply online.,2025-05-07T11:04:01Z,607

Part of that law was that no one could be denied an application if the store used paper ones, if not you had to explain to the person how to apply online. It was supposedly meant to help decrease all types of prejudice during the hiring process. It made no sense to me because if a manager was prejudice, that persn they didnt like would never make it past the first interview.

Sure, they possibly could, however, that doesn't account for training, the risk of a new hire possibly not fitting in or being even more of a pain to work with, and they already have as few people hired as possible, so they don't want to fire you, because even if they get a replacement, that's a role that's not going to be functioning properly, if at all for a while when you're gone.

For larger firms, this is worse than contacting recruiter directly. Interviewing screening and such are usually side things for hiring managers and are more focused on their primary senior job duties. They will more than likely get annoyed and ignore it completely. Especially these days where applicant to role ratios are wack. Chances are they already have dozens of folks contacting them directly.  Networking helps a lot: job fairs, friends, family, hobby groups. Have multiple people look over your resume. Practice interviewing. Other than that it's a number game.",2025-10-16T17:51:47Z,1

I am a new friend here at your channel, but I just wanted to say how much I LOVE how you encourage others to clap and support others! I used to host karaoke, and I kinda ""made"" people clap for performers, especially the ones who werent the best singers. My saying was ""We always clap for our friends because they had the cohones to get up here and sing!"" And that usually encouraged good applause. You basically do the same thing and I LOVE IT! Your energy is top tier. Thanks for being a blessing to so many.",2025-07-18T13:01:50Z,5

I'm taking a leap of faith with you. So many influencers give bogus jobs that are supposedly always hiring or that are really good jobs and it ends up being nothing but spam. I'm not even sure what made me click on the video in the first place but something told me to do it while I was cleaning and after listening I have decided to come back and to take notes. If I actually get a job because you gave me the information I don't even know what I can do in return for you because I am in desperate need of one and it would be a blessing to actually get a decent job especially if it's remote in which I don't have to worry about trying to find a ride nor walking for hours just to get to and from work.",2025-08-03T19:48:32Z,1

Bringing in Will Muschamp and a Florida running backs coach to Austin signals a clear commitment to upgrading the staff — not just filling roles. After losing key pieces of Sark’s original elite group like Tashard Choice, Blake Gideon, Terry Joseph, and others, there was no room for a drop-off. Last season showed that replacements mattered, and this year must be an upgrade to make up for that loss. Championship programs reload with experience, not experiments. SEC-tested coaches understand recruiting battles, physical football, and playoff pressure — exactly what Texas needs to take the next step. If Sark wants to capitalize on the talent on the roster and the future with Arch Manning, surrounding him with battle-tested coaches is non-negotiable. Early signs show Texas is moving in the right direction. Roald Gonzalez",2025-12-20T05:06:37Z,1

However, I can't see Trump being so kind. If he is desperate, he may force people to work or lose their benefits.

DEI wasn’t created to lower standards, it was created because, historically, not everyone even got a fair shot. It’s not just about race, it’s also about gender, disability, and making sure people from all backgrounds can succeed based on merit. Blaming DEI anytime something goes wrong is a slippery slope, especially if the root cause is more complex than just who got hired. DEI is a result of people going years being overlooked, excluded, and denied chances. DEI is more than just including people, it drives real improvement. Studies show diverse teams make better decisions, boost innovation, and lead to stronger financial performance. It helps companies attract top talent, reduce turnover, and connect with broader markets. When done right, DEI creates fair opportunities for everyone, not by lowering standards, but by removing unfair barriers so the most qualified people can thrive, regardless of race, gender, or background. I’d rather know who hired him and why? Without that info it’s just assumptions. DEI has nothing on knowing the people that are hiring these days.

I once followed you because I believed you genuinely cared about addressing destructive behavior in our community. But now, it seems like you’re projecting unresolved issues and turning that into hostility toward Black Americans. It’s disheartening to witness. What you’re doing doesn’t come across as constructive criticism: it is like self-hate disguised as accountability. Maybe it’s time to face the pain and heal from whatever personal experiences that has caused you to be this way towards Black Americans.   Do you even live in Texas? Because I do; and let me tell you, officials here, especially Republicans, have a long track record of not taking weather threats seriously. For example, one woman told CBS that her family managed to escape the flood by monitoring the river themselves rather than waiting for an official evacuation notice. Officials didn’t care and people were literally out here using their instincts and familiarity with river flooding.   You’re focusing on the Fire Chief, but are you even acknowledging the broader issue? If these allegations with the AFD Chief are true, it means Kerrville officials knew as early as July 2 that the area would flood and still failed to act by doing the simple such as initiate an evacuation. That kind of proactive move could’ve reduced the need for rescue swimmers in the first place; except for in the most extreme cases.   Lastly, it’s been documented that Kerrville had an opportunity to install a weather alert system near the area but chose not to—simply because of the cost. Why would they decline something so critical, especially knowing they live in a region literally known as Flood Alley? How come they allowed camping to be done around the river knowing it is prone to flooding? All of this reactive blaming, but nobody including you, have stopped to think about proactive measures that this county lacked throughout the years.   It’s disappointing to see you jump on the bandwagon and make the Fire Chief a scapegoat especially after you just criticized people like Sadè Perkins for politicizing this tragedy. Now you’re doing the exact same thing, throwing out political talking points instead of sticking to the facts.  As a pastor, I expected more from you. God sees everything, and He will hold you accountable for bearing false witness or participate in the slander of an innocent man (the AFD Chief).

You don’t get to his level and his placement without understanding all of the above of how things work. It is well known that Kristy Noam held up payments from FEMA funds to help with the more expensive parts of the cost of saving people with search and rescue, and that was after a request was made that she dragged her feet on.

DEI wasn’t created to lower standards, it was created because, historically, not everyone even got a fair shot. It’s not just about race, it’s also about gender, disability, and making sure people from all backgrounds can succeed based on merit. Blaming DEI anytime something goes wrong is a slippery slope, especially if the root cause is more complex than just who got hired. DEI is a result of people going years being overlooked, excluded, and denied chances. DEI is more than just including people, it drives real improvement. Studies show diverse teams make better decisions, boost innovation, and lead to stronger financial performance. It helps companies attract top talent, reduce turnover, and connect with broader markets. When done right, DEI creates fair opportunities for everyone, not by lowering standards, but by removing unfair barriers so the most qualified people can thrive, regardless of race, gender, or background. I’d rather know who hired him and why? Without that info it’s just assumptions. DEI has nothing on knowing the people that are hiring these days. That’s not a DEI hire, that’s a “oh we know you, “you can have the job.”😂 That’s a Lebron doing for Bronny move, Favoritism and connections win out most of the time.

Bringing in Will Muschamp and a Florida running backs coach to Austin signals a clear commitment to upgrading the staff — not just filling roles. After losing key pieces of Sark’s original elite group like Tashard Choice, Blake Gideon, Terry Joseph, and others, there was no room for a drop-off. Last season showed that replacements mattered, and this year must be an upgrade to make up for that loss. Championship programs reload with experience, not experiments. SEC-tested coaches understand recruiting battles, physical football, and playoff pressure — exactly what Texas needs to take the next step.

Bend but don’t break is an absolute time of possession killer and I think he wanted someone more aggressive that can get us the ball back to our offense quicker at times.   Those games where you get doubled up on time of possession eventually wear you down at the end of the season. Pk did a great job , credit to him. Sark thought he had a shot to upgrade and he took it, I like it.",2025-12-20T04:00:27Z,0

YkOyY6ChLGk,My Immediate Response to Texas FIRING PK AND HIRING Will Muschamp! ,,2025-12-19T13:01:19Z,@cjmcdonald3763,"The biggest flaw in PKs scheme was the soft ass coverage, especially on 3rd down, even more on 3rd and long. It killed us all year, any offense with a pulse can take advantage of that and they did. Say what you want though, PK recruited great talent, developed it and got a lot of dudes to the league. No arguing with that. But when Kirby called out the Texas physicality and intensity as a whole, that got under Sarks skin. And Sark knew he was right. I agree that bringing in Muschamp is more of a straight dog mentality move than schematic. That’s the edge that you will need to beat the top teams. Sark has proven himself to be able to handle the rivals and lesser opponents, he just needs a little help getting to the next level. We went as far as we could with PK, it’s time for the next step. All this said, Sark and the offense have to deliver if these are the changing being made. No excuse for not bringing in 1-2 grown men, burner RBs out of the portal. No excuse for anymore shaky o line and WR play. We could have the top two draft picks next year with Simmons and Arch and make another hella run in the playoffs.
