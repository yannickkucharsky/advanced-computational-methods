Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

Until people come together and stand up and speak the truth we are screwed, people would rather sit in a lie and in denial than admit the man they voted for is making mistakes. i mean come on just because you vote someone in dont mean you must agree with them on everything, or does it. This man has made threats to any one who speaks against him, those who say anything, even if they were his biggest supporters  will be shamed for speaking and he will ignore their claims as lies or fake news, im just speaking the facts and I was a trump supporter myself but i will not sit here and pretend that everything is great, i wont pretend he is perfect and never makes mistakes, because we all do. and i think these tariffs were a big mistake, we needed to be making our own before we started any of this tariff stuff, we needed to have factories making the same things as these other countries whom price it by what it truely cost before taking stuff away from poor people who cannot afford certain things any other way. POOR people have literally survived because of cheap alternatives like temu and shein for years, there are kids whose entire christmas was all due to temu because their parents couldnt afford gifts for all their kids any other way. I really feel badly for lil kids whose parents no longer have that option, some of the stuff may be junk to some yes, but to a kid whose never been able to play barbies, that dupe barbie was the best thing since sliced bread. when you have never had to live like that you shouldnt go around saying that people are stupid for buying junk telling them to stop buying junk when its their only way to give their kids a bday or christmas with gifts like everybody else. i am very very worried about this country, and until TRUMP himself gets out of his own head and makes an effort to understand the people who helped win him his throne, things will keep getting worse, he will keep making decisions based off a life of luxury, he has no clue what its like to HAVE NO CHOICE but buy cheap to survive, he expects everybody to be able to make themselves into billionaires and the truth is we CANT not when you got billionaires like him making all the choices based off their own life instead of basing those choices on the lives of your most vulnerable people. because the consequences hit them first and foremost,  and they cannot afford any more consequences, people are at the edge of the cliff and anymore will push them on over that edge and thats when kids start getting taken from parents that can no longer afford to raise them, then your foster care program will be full to its max of kids without homes which our goernment and ourselves will fit the bill for later on. these tariffs have also messed up things like churches giving out free boxes of food, its caused homeless shelters to have to shut their doors, the ripples are rippling out and hitting in places we never thought about, places that rely soley on donations and cheaper products to feed the homeless and the poor arent able to get those things anymore, stores refuse to give anything away now, and those who broker deals with churches and such arent brokering those deals because they say they can no longer afford it, and these places arent able to buy things straight up off the shelf they HAVE to get it cheap or free or they cant get it and so people wont even have that as an option anymore if something dont change soon and fast. i pray i am wrong and he sees it before its too late and he jumps on it and makes these companies eat a lil more or else we are all doomed including HIM.",2025-08-08T09:15:30Z,5

The issue is complex but to just point fingers at AI (which capability is unproven still) is stealing all of the grads jobs and even the non degree working the career ladder is just wrong. The social impacts of COVID as well as the lack of companies actually wanting to treat us as more than just paper pushers and no career movement.

At this age I witnessed the transition between no smartphone to smartphones everywhere, no social media to social media everywhere. Now I’m witnessing houses being somewhat affordable to unaffordable and decent job market to tough harsh job market.   I know this might sound tone deaf but I can only say from my experience and what I’m seeing in my job field. I’m an aircraft tech at a major airline. I make $68/hr right now. 6 weeks vacation + 5 major holidays I can take off or bank + 12 sick days/year + decent 401k contribution. Reason I’m saying this is to spread information and also because airlines are MASS hiring to replace the boomers which was the majority of the work force leaving within 5 years. You don’t need a degree , but you do need a license which takes year and half.   Maybe consider switching career while you job hunt ? School is not difficult at all. If I got it, you can trust me. Yeah it’s not an office job , you will probably have to work midnights at first. You will work out in the element. But it’s a job that’s mass hiring. Boomers are leaving, they need to backfill.   Just throwing it out there for ya that can’t find a job. The way I’m seeing it is AI will replace more and more as it gets better and bettter.   Also this isn’t a job field only for men. Yes it’s dominantly men, but I’ve seen decent amount of women in here that are an excellent tech.

The federal government has purposefully crashed the economy to forestall entitlement reforms, tax reform, immigration reform, and industrial policy reform. Any reforms would risk uprooting entrenched financial positions so they’re crashing the economy instead. AI should be a boon for productivity but that can only happen during economic growth periods. So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life. By the end of 2028 there will be a full blown economic depression similar to 2008, or perhaps even worse.",2025-10-02T22:40:01Z,13

Wages haven’t kept up with rent, food, or bills, and the so-called “opportunities” usually mean unstable gigs or soul-sucking jobs. To me, it feels like the system is already collapsing, propped up by older generations who still believe in it, while younger people like me can’t shake the emptiness it creates. From where I’m standing, stepping into that grind doesn’t look like building a life. it looks like giving yourself away to something that was never designed for you to thrive in.

Even at minimum wage, I had management riding me nonstop to be faster every night I worked.  This was a minimum wage job, yet they treated it like Amazon warehouse where they keep pushing you every day you work to be faster and do more in less time.  I was written up for the dumbest stuff.  One night I was stocking I had 4 mixed pallets on one end of my aisle and 1 pallet of just my stuff at the other.  Management called me to the office and said they're writing me up for not working because that 1 pallet is still sitting there at the end of my aisle.  I explained he obviously didn't see the other 4 mixed pallets which my stuff on top buried everyone else's stuff underneath so I was trying to move that off and stock it because you're not supposed to leave boxes strewn across the floor.  Management said they didn't see it and apologized, but said they still had to write me up because they had already called me to the office and it would look bad on them for pulling me away from my work for nothing.  That was back in 2015.  I'm sure Walmart is a lot harder today.  I changed jobs went to a grocery store doing minimum wage.  The grocery store refused to provide benefits, so everyone was scheduled less than 20hrs/wk.  I had just graduated from college (in my 30s) and had 10 years of customer service/retail exp under my belt and they treat me like I'm below the high school kids they were hiring that sit around drinking gatorade and playing on their phones.  Anyway, minimum wage jobs for the past 10 years couldn't afford an apartment, and I'm sure nowadays they can't either.  My old apartment up near the university was across the street from the grocery store used to be $600/month.  Today, it's practically doubled in rent, and the neighborhood now has a lot of problems with drugs.  A nice apartment in that university town you're looking at paying $3k+ for a single.  I left to China in 2019 because I couldn't find a job with my BA degree from the university right there in that town.  The Career Center at the university kept telling me to apply for GEICO insurance because they just opened new offices and needed help.  Her husband worked there.  I applied and went through round 1 of interviews 3 times.  They always ghost me after that.  So one day I called GEICO and asked to speak with the HR because I really wanted to know yes or no whether I got the job.  They told me the HR will be working on Thursdays.  I called back on Thursday, and the HR was out of town down in Florida on a family vacation.  I'm sitting there like, ""you could have told me she was going to be out of the office this thursday, call back next thursday, but you didn't.""  Felt like they just were making up stories and the job postings on Indeed might have been fake to appear like they're hiring when they were not.  I was also upset with the career center for not helping me find work.  You would think the school would be helping graduates find work because it'd show that their university degrees actually have value!  Instead, they didn't help me.  I had to go out and find my own job teaching in China.  I wish I could end there, but covid started 6 months after I arrived.  Their visa situation was chaos and my visa expired during a lockdown, so I couldn't get another work visa and I had to return home.  Now I'm jobless, living at home, taking care of my grandmother that was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  If she goes into a nursing home, we'll lose the house.  I've tried finding work when I came home from China, but employers just laugh me out the door.  The only type of job hiring right now is heavy industrial, and I don't have any heavy industrial skills.  I'm an academic, not a tradesman.  You say the job market is on the edge?  I'd say it's already collapsed when even young generation are struggling to find entry level positions and salaries everywhere are not keeping up with inflation and the rising cost of living.",2025-09-02T05:00:45Z,93

Apply for thousands of fake indeed  tax-write-off listing jobs per week to document in order to receive said benefit.

These include the overall phenomenon called ""structural unemployment.""  Some economists have predicted this for decades because of its Malthusian essence.  Too many people, not enough jobs.  It will never return to what was.  It's not part of normal economic cycles that the experts are so fond of citing. It's exacerbated by AI and robotics.  Unless the government was proactive in planning to make society more socialistic, and improving conditions for citizens, then it's a down hill slide towards a plutocracy. Unfortunately that's the widening chasm between the rich and the poor, leaving the mid-class in tatters trying to maintain their standard of living in a country where the average person is involved in a non-consensual relationship with an economy hell bent on fleecing the shit out of people.  The automobile is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on a populace. Just add up all the costs inherent in the operation of your car and hang up and drive.  The fender bender industry wants you on your phone, with headlights unique to each model and absurd prices for injection molded parts with insane margins. Back to the acyclic economic milieu in which we exist.  The end of the petroleum age means that we are seeing prices rise based on a truer calculation of embedded costs.   The slow death of urban core retail means that commercial real estate is getting shitty, and that sector has anchored funds and such for years.   Bankers are slow to adjust. Every company is squeezing everything for revenue, meaning the firings and the terrible job market are the tip of the iceberg. The guy who got voted in isn't doing anything to help you folks that believed the rhetoric.  He just wants to aggrandize himself and his cronies by reviving the polluting of our country while bad mouthing renewable energy because of its effect on the ""landscape.""   Since when has he given a shit about the natural world? Has he visited an open pit mine recently.  He has doubled his net worth over the last 6-18 months, while most US citizens are suffering.   Make no mistake: He doesn't give a shit about any of us, unless you're part of the war machine dominated by the Big 5 and go to Davos or Tetons.   Over Easter he dismissed us all and said ""just enjoy your life"" in a display of such callous indifference the average person's plight as to be obscene. He has begun to take away the basic right to free speech and his attacks on people smarter than he is who criticize what is happening is truly frightening.  We should all be very concerned and petition our generally greedy representatives who are often focused on their own inside information making their assisted stock market picks way easier. Stop attacking people who you might call liberal and understand that it will require all of us to find accord and quorum to achieve any progress.

Even with the average downward revision of 76,000/month, job creation during that year was healthy, and in comparison to job creation under Trump, it was strong. The downward revisions do not change the fact that there was strong job growth throughout the Biden administration. This revision means that the Biden administration created 15.5 million jobs. By comparison, the first Trump administration saw a loss of almost 3 million jobs. In the second Trump administration, job creation has again turned stagnate. President Trump rushed to call the Biden administration a disaster. But, it quickly rescued the economy from the doldrums he left behind, then showed uninterrupted growth for 3 & 1/2 years.

Moreover, we don't know when these ""job losses"" occurred, and there is no breakdown of when the revisions occurred. So, to imply that since most of the time covered by the revision is in the Biden Administration it cannot be said that those job losses are in the timespan of the Biden Administration. Next, is it possible that industry has manipulated these numbers for their benefit? We have had price inflation, this by the way, doomed the Democrats election chances and brought Trump to power. Could industry which claimed labor prices were a driver for price inflation were intentionally mis/under reported and claimed as a reason for inflation? That misreporting could've covered the fake reason for price inflation, and the fleecing of American consumers. Keep in mind that the BLS is only as good as the data that is REPORTED and there is no penalty for fabrication of numbers of jobs generated. It's up to the states and industry to insure that the correct numbers are reported. Finally, we have revisions every quarter and now the revisions for the year are revised downward? Something that needs to be investigated, but more likely than not won't be by the Trump Administration. Trump will likely blame the Biden Administration, without support, and not mention that the data provided that was the basis of the initial and revised reports were provided by industry itself. As an old programmer adage goes: ""Garbage in Garbage out.""",2025-09-09T20:38:43Z,5

The tax passed but was repealed after Amazon threatened to leave Seattle. Seattle's 2025 Payroll Tax: Seattle recently passed a payroll expense tax on individual compensation exceeding $1 million. This tax was proposed by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell and City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and was later approved by voters. It is intended to fund permanently affordable housing. Other Seattle Tax Proposals: Seattle is currently debating other tax proposals, including a measure to rebalance the Business and Occupation (B&O) tax to lower taxes for many small businesses while raising revenue from larger companies. Additionally, the city council recently approved a proposal to increase the city's sales tax to fund public safety programs. “",2025-11-01T19:02:36Z,0

Their concerns include their grandchildren’s future, civil liberties (especially First Amendment rights), and immigration policies like the family separation policy from 2017–2018. Some are lifelong activists, such as those who protested the Vietnam War, while others are new to civil disobedience, driven by emotional reactions to Trump’s presidency. Although older Americans traditionally lean Republican (over 50% in age groups 60+), a visible minority actively protests. White House adviser Stephen Miller dismissed them as “elderly white hippies,” a term some protesters humorously embrace. Many describe a renewed sense of purpose and camaraderie, comparing it to activism from decades ago. Organizers aim to involve younger activists but face challenges like cultural differences and accessibility needs. Seniors acknowledge their disconnect from modern cultural references but remain dedicated to their cause.",2025-10-04T09:26:46Z,3

Entry-level today, mid/late career tomorrow, C-suite the next day. Starting with the great decoupling in the 1970s, human labor has been and will continue trending to zero. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY. Automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system. Think about this-today, AI is the WORST it will ever be going forward. It DOESN'T MATTER if AI ""creates"" 200 million new jobs...AI will solve and execute these new ""jobs"" much faster than humans will be able to adapt, learn, and fill them. Capital/employee model-it worked great...for quite a while. However, now companies that automate lower their costs, become more competitive. Those that keep higher-cost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business. This creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely, but necessary for company survival. There is a way to deal with this humanely, but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work. Even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and there’s no one left with money to buy the crap they’re selling.  I know, LLMs are leveling off, ""what about the energy?,"" blah, blah, blah. Do not conflate LLMs with AI. LLMs are no more AI than vacuum tubes are computers or AOL dial-up is the internet. So, LLMs are leveling off. History shows technological advance is not just one sigmoid curve. It's a series of sigmoid curves with each successive one reaching new capabilities and new heights. To think that after 200,000 years, this pattern is all the sudden going to stop is absurd. I also understand there will be new jobs for humans created, it will go in this pattern: Automation creates 5 new jobs this year, lays off 30; creates 5 new jobs next year, lays off 500; creates 5 new jobs the following year, lays off 1500 etc. In the macro economic picture, do you not see this as an issue? I also understand there is more opportunity for entrepreneurs. Again, from the macro perspective there is a MINORITY of people that have the entrepreneurial ability/spirit. It takes that, and a strong majority of people don't have it.  Reasoning AI Is the Next Big Leap. The future of AI is not just about generating answers, but about “reasoning” breaking down complex problems step-by-step, more like a human brain. Breakthroughs like DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like GPT and xAI, marking a shift toward more advanced, thoughtful AI. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY.  There’s a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goal-driven institutions like politicians, universities, and tech company executives, that the future of work is secure. The claim goes: “You just need to learn how to work with AI,” and humans collaborating with AI will outperform either one alone. But recent research, including a landmark study from the University of Virginia, tells a different story. In diagnosing medical conditions, AI alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by AI. The median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using Chat GPT Plus was 76.3%, while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was 73.7%. Sounds like “a win” at first. However, Chat GPT Plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than 92%. In other words, the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling. In many fields, AI is not just a tool, it is the superior performer. This has staggering implications for the future of work, especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go “You just need to be retrained.” To the group advocating the ""retraining solution,"" I pose to you this: You have a medical doctor, just finished 8 years of higher education, a low-paid 4-year internship/residency, is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and just got outperformed by automation; what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job?  The result of this, since the United States' moronic system is based on taxing employees for about 70% of all tax revenue, this will further exacerbate the problem. Tax needs to be based on what's going on now and in the future not what worked 75 years ago. Oh I know it's so evil to think, but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation. Even if you do that, it's a win-win. For instance say a company had 1,000 employees in automated away down to 100. 1,000 employees paid federal taxes, including payroll tax, of about 20 million a year. Now the 100 people pay about 2 million a year. However, by automating, the company sees two things: they are no longer paying approximately 60 million in wages and their share of payroll tax, AND since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits. What's so wrong about taxing that company for the $60 million dollars they don't have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation. Not all the additional profits, but some of them. If you do that there's a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company. That's a win-win for the government and for businesses. If humanity, as a whole, weren't so stupid, we would just adjust as tech progresses to where EVERYONE benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the post-labor economy.  To understand this shift, consider the historical role of the horse and oxen. They were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture, transport, and industry. Technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output, making them even more valuable. But then came the steam engine and, later, the internal combustion engine. These machines didn’t just help the horse, but outperformed it entirely. Trains, tractors, and trucks could do the job ten, even a hundred times faster and more powerfully. And from that moment forward, the horse was no longer critical to economic output. It was, in essence, unemployed.  This is what AI and robotics are doing to human labor. They are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical; they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition, strategy, design, and communication. And just like the horse, our value in the economic system will diminish, not from lack of talent or effort, but because machines will do the job better. That’s why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining, but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production. When the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded (be that strength, endurance, dexterity, analysis, creativity, empathy, intelligence, persuasion as well as many other qualities) that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output.  Potential solution. Decentralized AI Ownership: A Bridge Toward Post-Scarcity. While Universal Basic Income (UBI) may serve as an initial economic stopgap, bridging today’s economy with tomorrow’s abundance consider an even more equitable and long-term solution: Decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself.   Rather than concentrating the power of AI in the hands of a few corporations or governments, envision a model where AI entities are open-source and collectively owned. This could take the form of assigning each person a digital ""share"" of an AI system, not unlike a stakeholder’s share in a company. As the AI produces value, whether through intellectual labor, creative output, or autonomous economic participation, those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals.   This model would ensure that as AI becomes the dominant productive force in society, the wealth it creates is shared universally, not monopolized. It aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone, not just a few early adopters or private entities. In practice, this could look like:   - AI systems running Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that distribute profits algorithmically. - Smart contracts ensuring transparent, equitable income flows based on collective stake. - Global “AI cooperatives” where users vote on how AI is used, improved, and deployed. - Universal basic compute.   If AI becomes the primary driver of economic output, then equitable access to its benefits isn’t just fair, it’s necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability. It provides a scalable, technologically aligned extension to UBI, ensuring people not only have income, but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines.   Ultimately, decentralized AI ownership may be the last transition phase before full post-scarcity, when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete. Until then, however, models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands, and where wealth can, for the first time in history, truly be universal.",2025-11-07T18:34:54Z,1

I got lucky to qualify for disability due to my back problems, and trauma from a guy kicking down my door in 2020 which I wont go into but caused ptsd... i dont want to stay on it. it doesnt give me anywhere near enough. but no job is secure enough or pays enough to risk losing my ssdi. Every degree im interested in is a risk that pays peanuts even with a bachelor's. What is even the point? I just coach my son to not be lazy in HS like I was. Get into votech. Get a degree like x ray tech. Easy , always needed, and not a long time to be in school, and it pays well.",2025-08-26T14:54:21Z,1

You guys all played call of duty or counter strike? If other side has a cheat code and cheating, you are a God fearing honest person, your likelihood of winning the game is ZERO.

Now companies are letting people go or not hiring to level things out. This is also amplified due to massive increase in capex spending for AI infrastructure.  Companies are not hiring or doing layoffs because of previous over hiring and increases in spending.  When rates go down (and they will because the government needs to refinance their debt), this is going to create more investment (probably in AI or other tech areas) which will create more hiring.   The thing is, once rates drop, they will likely stay low for some time because the government wants higher inflation to erode their newly refinanced debt. It's the only option to decrease their debt to GDP.",2025-08-18T17:24:23Z,1

Many people in gen Z just aren't up to having the kind of professional careers to which they aspire. The bar was set very low so everyone could go to college and get a degree and have a cushy job, and now the outputs of that process are bumping up against reality. It didn't used to be that everyone went to college and got a degree. How much middle management do you think really exists in the economy? Some of you need to go get jobs in the trades. These pay very well and, furthermore, you're just not the intellects that your mommies and daddies told you you were. Yes, you, mommies precious, probably aren't really especially talented. You people need to come to grips with reality and with your own mediocrity too. You want to overthrow capitalism and make things more equitable for everyone? I'm right there with you.

In the tirst place Canada thru its various governments have been paying(buying) these jobs in Canada all along... If you take the amount of jobs the big 3 actually created here in Canada and compare it to Canada's working Population Canada has been taken advantage of for YEARS... We've given trillions of dollars in grants and loans and tax reductions to basically BUY this small amount of Jobs... Canada is just as much to blame as America but with decades of Weak Leadership here in Canada we've allowed Washington to take Advantage...A big reason for the dumbass free trade agreement all those years ago was mostly based around the Auto Industry because for what ever reason Vehicle production can't seem to be done in one location, not sure why as i don't think the electronics or other industries create TV's by building part here in Canada and then send it to America for something and then back to Canada to the 3rd step... Ontario in particular benefited by the jobs it created but still its a dumb way to make things while letting the Big 3 sell vehicles here without duties... America benefited more then Canada as these are AMERICAN companies basically getting a tax free grift from Canada... In light of Trumps Stupiditly and because Mr Carney being a finicial expert HE understands the implications of all of this and is moving Canada away from the American Table as we don't want their table scraps anymore... Honestly... I'd like to see Canada's Auto market open up to everyone Tarrif Free no matter where the vehicle is made... Canadians Want Good Cheap Cars and the Big 3 cars are not all that good... Good EV's from China are great the same as European vehicles as well... NOW regarding the Big 3 I would say this... They build the products they want to sell in Canada in Canada otherwise its 100% tariff for them... Canada needs to get paid back for all those jobs these companies abandoned here in Canada by Fearing the Orange Turd otherwise let them stick to their American Market...",2025-12-18T02:52:27Z,1

We did not.  Complex answer, we played the long game. While Trump was tweeting and barking orders, Canada was redirecting our trades to true allies. Normally a process that takes many months or even years to accomplish, but due to the shared concerns about USA stability and lack of trustworthiness, our allies also wanted to fast track the trade & defense partnerships.  After a mere six months, we are already seeing results. USA tariffs on wood products. I hope they did not need that, it will not be coming back to USA for at least a decade. Say goodbye to 55% of your wood & paper products. Lithium? Sorry bud, we are sending that to EU now, with a bunch of our copper. Rest of our copper now belongs to UK. The aluminum, steel & rare elements are next to go, and already cut off from China supplies. Looks like USA can not manufacture anything by end of the month.
