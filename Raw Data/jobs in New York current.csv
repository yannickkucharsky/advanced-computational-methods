The hospitality is insane! My girlfriend and I had a random impromptu date night and did the “roll the dice and have no choice but to go eat there” restaurant decision thing. Of course it would land on the most boujie, classiest restaurant I’ve ever been in. Here I am wearing fkn Under Armour “The Rock - BSR” tshirt and Nike pants and Air Force 1 sneakers and my gf wearing a decently classy shirt and black Lulu’s with black slides. We were treated as if we were wearing friggin Armani suit and tie and friggin Gucci dress! It was thee best experience I have ever had in a classy restaurant. 10/10 and we kept going back there ever since. Date night go-to we call it now. Mind you we dress better than we did the first time we went tho. And we’re still mocked for it to this day every time we go in. It’s hilarious. We will walk in, state our reservation and the maître d’, waitress, waiter, (garçon) will say to us, “no casual wear tonight, guys?” Or “oh what a surprise, you two are dressed to impress tonight!” 😂😂😂 omg the laugh we get is amazing. Great place. I won’t name it as it’s in Canada 🇨🇦 Moncton, New Brunswick so absolutely nobody will give two shits about it even if I did mention it 😂. But a good story to tell our friends. This video reminded me of that experience my gf and I had. My deepest apologies for the long ass lengthy comment. If you got this far I am grateful and happy. Bless you all and have a great day.

Orang Indo tipikal orang² yang Feodalisme, intinya mereka yang levelnya lebih tinggi suka membuat aturan yang harus dipatuhi orang² yang levelnya rendah. Contoh simple nya kayak yang terjadi di sekolah dimana lu as a junior harus nurutin apa keinginan senior lu yang bahkan di luar aturan sekolah, terus culture yang seperti itu lu lanjutin lagi pas udah jadi senior dan yang kena junior² lu. Ini gak bagus sih dan apalagi kalo culture seperti ini dibawa ke dunia kerja, beuh gak bakalan ada yang beres, makanya gue jujur gak mau bersikap seperti ini ke orang² karna gue tau hal² seperti ini cuman akan merugikan banyak orang aja dan dipandang rendah tuh semenyakitkan itu, apalagi di dalam dunia pekerjaan tuh gak selalu orang² yang levelnya di bawah adalah orang² yang gak punya pengalaman atau punya kinerja yang buruk atau sebaliknya, jadi gak masalah kalo senioritas digunakan untuk saling menjaga kesopanan tapi kalo udah masuk di luar itu yaa udah beda lagi.",2025-04-22T03:51:35Z,5

It allows the child to still have food even if they were on a late bus or their parents dropped them off late because something came along when on the way to school, so there’s no punishment for life happening that was out of the child’s control. We should have this as a norm for all schools in the US to allow kids breakfast no matter how late they are to school because every kid deserves a meal ❤️",2025-09-19T17:03:48Z,13

The CA course, including Foundation, Intermediate, and Final levels, typically takes a minimum of 4.5 to 5 years to complete. This includes the required articleship training period of three years. Even for graduates entering through the direct entry route, the minimum duration is 4.5 years.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  Foundation Level: 6 months Intermediate Level: 8-10 months Articleship Training: 3 years Final Level: 6-12 months While some students might be able to accelerate their studies by studying intensely, passing exams quickly, and potentially completing the final level in one year after clearing the intermediate level, this would be an exception rather than the norm.

There were so many times those meals came in handy as a broke college student, and our silly conversations were always the highlight of my weekends.   The hospital kitchen staff don’t get enough recognition for the morale they add to the hospital.

But It all ended up in the trash when pain nausea hit. So after the whole event when me and my baby were settled I was just in time for breakfast again. Let me tell you I cried over that breakfast burrito and hot chocolate it was the most soul filling gift on a plate I could have asked for after an exhausting labor and every meal after was something to look forward to while I recovered for a couple days.

As a person who worked as a CNA for 18 years,  I am so happy that hospital cooks are finally getting their recognition!  For patients and staff, they are our lifelines and morale boosters, especially the healthcare staff  who works nightshift. As healthcare workers, we often either forget to bring our own lunch or we're too busy to prep food at home, they can make or break a shift especially on nights when there are really no restaurants around that are open in the middle of the night.  If me and my coworkers know that one of our favorite cooks is in the kitchen, then chances are we are going to have really good night shift. To all my healthcare workers (Doctors, nurses, RTs, PTs, CNAs, Techs, etc.), please be kind to your hospital kitchen staff, especially on nightshift. They know they can't always work on our schedule and they also understand that you priorities are the patients. Treat them right and I promise you,  they will take care  of you because  the hospital cooks are also  our healthcare workers!",2025-02-09T21:38:14Z,31

I worked in a Hospital cafeteria, and a lot of people don't know what goes on behind the scenes.  The staff are doing their best and they work VERY hard. Some of the cooks in my Hospital would sometimes stay HOURS late to help finish meals for the patients, and then come back the next morning. Sometimes we would only have one cook for the entire Hospital, sometimes stuff breaks and certain foods can't be made, depending on the patients sometimes you have to pull a supervisor to sign off on a tray make sure the meal is prepped correctly, it's a lot. Staff in other positions sometimes look down on kitchen and cafeteria workers, so I hope this helps people understand how hard they work to feed everyone.",2025-02-19T11:47:44Z,25

To understand that you have maxed out your energy and its time to walk away is inspiring. 3. Learning any trade when your older can be challenging unless your willing to take risk. 4. Often times you have the potential of doing something other but not everyone is willing to take that 1st step of faith, you will never know if you will succeed or fail unless you try. 5. Whether she recognizes her skill or not, cobbling is in her blood. I'm 100% certain you can follow this trait or working hands on throughout her family history. The ability, creativity and the discipline were already present they just needed to be cultivated when the time was right. This is why she learned in such a short time. 5. It's so rewarding on a personal level (IMO) when your work can benefit others and bring a smile, life is better when you serve others. 6. Just because your challenged; difficulty is part of every process. Learning a new set of skills is hard! This is being realistic but, it doesn't mean you should stop. Take a break and work through the issue, give yourself time to think, breathe and learn. Im pretty sure I just might be giving myself some advice here lol.  Phenomenally inspiring story that reflects believing in one self, the ability to dream while stepping out on that conviction, and what dedication and hardwork look like. Achievement takes effort!  Best wishes to all who tackle new endeavors in 2026! Including myself, projects are on the  table....blessings to all ❤🙏",2026-01-04T19:30:38Z,1

Unfortunately, I believe I was misled by those schools, because after 2.5 years, I still couldn’t find a job in tech. I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that I might not be able to start a career as a software engineer, so I recently accepted a job as a teller at a local bank.  I love watching your videos—they inspire me—but they also make me a little sad that I couldn’t achieve what I set out to do.",2025-04-06T17:43:15Z,97

I think you are doing great.... everyone does it different... and you have found a way to be happy. I used to do different free things that the library had going on, and go to some free meals too....  I used to buy the eggs, toast, sausage and hash brown breakfast for really cheap, but liked sitting at the counter and talking to different people.  Once your student loan gets paid off, you can save more...... my only recommendation would be to not buy so many coffees, and pay more on student loan... because someone is profiting on that interest that you could use for something better.... you are smart!

Has the code been properly tested? If an AI was used to generate those tests, were the tests manually reviewed thoroughly? Ensuring that it didn’t make a suite full of garbage tests, just so that it can get close to a 100% pass rate. A multiplier of this makes work more challenging, not easy.  Is it maintainable? Did it make a bunch of unnecessary abstractions that make it difficult to understand? Again, a multiplier of this makes the work more challenging, not easy.  Did it generate code using outdated dependencies that have been subjected to numerous security issues? This multiplies the number of security risks, which again, makes the work more challenging.  I understand that the speed of delivery is important. However, if you develop at a speed where you disregard these concerns, they’ll come back to bite you eventually and cause greater harm than if you took the correct precautions in the first place.",2025-10-27T08:59:13Z,786

Simple projects might see bigger gains, but enterprise software development involves much more than just writing code. It's worth noting that AI assistants are tools that augment human work rather than replace human judgment and expertise. They can speed up some tasks like boilerplate code generation or debugging, but they don't independently ""think"" or understand context the way humans do. They're pattern-matching systems that work best with clear instructions. The relationship between AI coding tools and business outcomes like sales isn't straightforward either. Even if developers write code faster, that doesn't automatically translate to more revenue—product-market fit, user experience, and business strategy still matter most. Better prompts definitely improve AI outputs, but they're not a magic solution. The quality of results still depends heavily on the problem's complexity, the human's expertise in reviewing and integrating the output, and realistic expectations about what these tools can and cannot do.",2025-10-27T11:26:17Z,5

I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt.

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting..

Sold the truck about a year ago and now I’m ready to get out of the trucking business altogether. Like he mentioned it’s a lot of time away from home and as I get older and become more family oriented I want to be home a reasonable amount of time. Also, I have other business goals that’s hard to accomplish when you’re stuck in a truck away from home a couple of days at a time. Already started my journey into real estate as a wholesaler and soon to be investor, and I’m planning on changing careers to become an electrician.

Diese Stadt hat mich genervt und sie ist unglaublich stressig. Die Menschen in New York sind auch unfassbar gestresst und von vielen Städten in den USA mit am unfreundlichsten. Persönlich am schönsten für mich, fand ich die Stadt Seattle. Die Leute sind sehr ausgeglichen und es gibt noch eine hohe Lebensqualität an Freizeitaktivitäten. Meine Freundin war glaub ich sehr froh, als sie mit dem Studium fertig war und ist wieder zurück nach San Francisco. Wobei diese Stadt auch immer mehr an Lebensqualität verliert, da das Silicon Valley schon fast alle Künstler verdrängt hat und übrig bleiben die, die es sich leisten können und die Anzahl der Obdachlosen steigt rasant.

Super leben! Das sind pro Jahr 28.800 Dollar an Miete für dieses kleine Zimmerchen in New York und in 10 Jahren summiert das dann 288.000 Dollar und für den Preis 288k kriegst du in anderen Bundesstaaten schon ein ganzes Haus. In New York ist man nicht frei, man drehtbsich wie verrückt im Hamsterrad. Ich würde mir in Texas auf dem Land ein schönes Haus mit Garten kaufen und in 10 Jahren abbezahlen. Im Bundesstaat Texas hast du viel mehr Freiheiten als im engen überreguliertem New York. Ist natürlich auch immer eine Altersfrage. Wenn man jung ist, zieht es einen eher in die Stadt, dort wo die Clubs sind, wo Nightlife ist... ich habe als junger Mann selbst 11 Jahre in Berlin gelebt, aber da war Berlin auch noch mega preiswert! Ich habe damals vor 20 Jahren nur 400 Euro warm für schöne eine 65 qm Altbauwohnung in Berlin-Friedrichshain gezahlt - mit richtigem Parkett, Badewanne und begehbarem Kleiderschrank. Damals hat Döner wegen dem Dönerkrieg in Berlin nur 1,50 Euro gekostet, Pizza gab es ab 2,50 Euro und Pasta schon ab 2,90 Euro. Heute kostet die selbe Wohung 1.500,- Euro kalt. Der Döner kostet 8 Euro und die Pizza gibt es ab 12,50 Euro. Das mit der Heizung, dass die zentral gesteuert wird und man die in den einzelnen Wohnungen nicht selbst regulieren kann, war mir völlig neu. Ich habe immer nur in Hotels gewohnt und ich war immer nur im Herbst und Winter in New York, aber wie das mit den Heizungen war, daran erinnere ich mich nicht. Es war halt nie kalt im Hotelzimmer, daher brauchte ich vermutlich nie etwas regulieren. und daher weiß ich es nicht. Aber mich erinnert das sehr an Minsk. Ich war nach der Wende und dem Fall des ""Eisernen Vorhangs"", ich meine es war 1992, 1993 oder 1994 (ich weiß nicht ganz genau) mal in Minsk, der Hauptstadt von Weißrussland. Das war damals alles noch sehr heruntergekommen, die ganzen Häuser, die Strtaßen, das ganze Straßenbild war wie eine Zeitreise, alles war uralt und überall brückelte der Putz, waren Risse in den Fassaden, ich erinnere mich noch an so extremst hässliche wilde Muser an den Tapeten, jedenfalls liefen dort die Heuzkörper, die so mega dick schon waren, also viel dicker als in Deutschland damals, immer auf volle Pulle. Es gab keine Thermostate. Ich hatte das Thermostat gesucht und dann wurde mir gesagt, man kann die Heizung nicht regulieren es gibt nur im Keller ""auf"" oder ""zu"" und wenn es zu warm ist, dann macht man einfach die Fenster auf. Ich saß dann da mit zwei weit geöffneten Fenstern und draußen schneite es... dass es sowas heute auch noch in New York gibt, hätte ich nicht erwartet. Wirklich nicht, obwohl ich New York selber auch als teilweise sehr rückständig in der Infrastruktur, im Verkehr und sowieso die kompletten USA als sehr rückständig und einfach in der gesamten Bauweise von Gebäuden wahrgenommen habe. Dann gehste in die New Yorker U-.Bahn und dann tropft es überall von der Decke, du guckst hoch auf die blanke Stahlbetondecke und dann siehst du überall Stellen wo es tropft, wo der Beton abgeplatzt ist und du auf das bereits rostige Metall in dem Beton guckst und keinen interessiert es... warst du mal in der Moskauer U-Bahn? Dort ist es gaaaaanz anders. Dort hast du Stuck an den Wänden, dort hängen zum Teil Kronleuchter und du hast überall prachtvolle Wandgemälde und gar kein einziges Grafitti. New York ist außen hui und innen pfui. Du musst aufpassen, wenn du irgendwo etwas mietest, ob Wohnnung, AirBnB oder Hotel, weil die eine Plage von Kakalaken, Bettwanzen und Ratten in der Stadt haben. Du siehst die Ratten sogar herumflitzen. Die Stadt ist dreckig und voll mit einerseits geisteskranken Verrückten, Kriminellen und Asozialen und anderrerseits mit Juppies, die aufgrund in der Vergangenheit manifestiertem geringem Selbstbewusstsein den Drang nach Anerkennung verspüren und sich ständig produzieren und Selbstdarstellern, die in der Stadt ihr Glück versuchen und dafür bereit sind einen sehr hohen Preis zu zahlen, der sich in den meisten Fällen rückblickend nicht auszahlen wird. Sicherlich ist es eine Erfahrung in New York zu leben oder dort mal eine Zeit lang gelebt zu haben. Mich hat damals das erste Mal New York total geflashed. Du kommst dort hin und du denkst du bist in einer komplett anderen Welt.",2025-10-25T14:17:47Z,5

Das bezieht sich aber insbesondere wohl auf das ""Herz"" New Yorks, von wo eben alles vorhanden, leicht fußläufig oder mit Subway erreichbar ist, und quasi Tag und Nacht Leben herrscht. Wer erschwinglichere Mieten möchte, muss halt längeres pendeln in Kauf nehmen, um morgens nach New York zur Arbeit zu kommen.  Wirklich gesunde Lebensmittel sind aber letztendlich in den ganzen USA viel teurer als in Europa. Europa hat viel, viel strengere Regularien, selbst in den Lebensmitteln die auch in Europa als nicht gesund gelten.  Ob es allerdings z. B. für einen 70 -jährigen Rentner, wie den ehemaligen Kellner aus dem Bericht, eine sinnvolle Entscheidung ist weiter in New York zu leben, ohne all die Vorzüge von New York nutzen zu können ? Er lebt dort wahrscheinlich nur ein sehr einsames Leben in einem winzigen Apartment, ohne irgendwelche Abwechslungen in seinem Leben. Ähnlich wie in Kalifornien, wo auch eine ganze Menge Menschen leben, die in Bundesstaaten mit niedrigeren Mieten und Lebenshaltungskosten besser aufgehoben wären, als jeden Tag mit ihrem verfügbaren Einkommen struggeln zu müssen.  Mal abgesehen vom ewigen Lärm und Hektik, könnte ich mir dort ein dauerhaftes Leben nur vorstellen, wenn es mindestens auf gutem Mittelstand Niveau finanzierbar wäre. Finanziell rumkraxeln, dabei in irgendeinem Mini Apartment von 10 qm für 1.000 $ und mehr leben, ist was für junge Abenteurer. Die es in New York aber auch haufenweise gibt.",2025-09-30T13:12:29Z,5

The way the app squeezes walkers for money is real.  They force a race to the bottom on your rates by not allowing you to even request booking if your rate is “outside the avg in your area”.  But it doesn’t let you know exactly what that even is.  Also all the data tracking is icky…. And thanks to this vid I now know why the experience has been getting worse for years.

They changed things a bit so you can see and know more now, but other problems like door codes not being given/how to get into the building. Really awkward to have to wait for someone to come out so you can come in because the owner wouldn't leave the door code or a key.
