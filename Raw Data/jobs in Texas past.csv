At least that was the conclusion that I came up with. My family and I lived in Midland for 3 years, from 2014 to 2017. We move there because my husband is in the oil field, And we were trying to keep the family together.  I have to agree with you everyone I spoke to prior to movin told me not to do it and that it was a horrible place.  Needless to say I was looking over my shoulder for about the 1st year waiting on something horrible to happen , thank God,   it never did.  We really liked Midland ,the people were nice, The food was good, And the weather was uneventful. Coming from Louisiana that was a good thing !  We had a sun in middle school at the time he had no problems there except for the lack of entertainment for school age kids.  In my opinion they could really benefit from a waterpark , or an amusement park, even  just a  Go kart track or Mini golf course would be nice. The other negative that I found was how far Midland Texas is from , well.... everything !   It really is in the middle of nowhere . So,  aside from being in the middle of the desert, and the cost of living being expensive,  It's not a bad place to call home, at least for a little while.",2022-02-09T14:08:04Z,4

I’m thinking of getting out of Miami. I need change. I was wondering if it would be a good time to move to Midland this new year coming up 2021? I need to reset my life. I have relatives leave there. I’m just doing lots of research on this town I’m so glad I came across your video. This is amazing. Thanks 🙏🏽,2020-12-12T04:43:02Z,0

In the past 10 yrs locals have become more rare. I would say this is one of the reasons this town has become so trashed. We used to be proud of how clean and beautiful our town used to be. We didn’t have homeless people living on the sides of the highway because we were able to accommodate those in need. It’s has become so sad to see what our town has become because people just come make money and leave they don’t care to put back into the community because it’s not their town.,2019-09-12T20:54:01Z,28

Finally i had time to see your all videos (maise netflix hahah ). I like your opinion about people who complain about their city or job. For me, people who complain about everything dont have self love. Really. If u dont like work, live at a city or anything else, just move on! Just get out!  Dont do this with your self, u know?   Here in Brazil we have a city like a midland (macaé, rj. Its not the same, of course hahah), people came here to work in oil and industry, and its all! People say things not so cool about this city, but, u know, for me is different. Macae is amazing, beautiful beaches, crossfit gym, I love work in SLB here. Of course is not the best city of the world! But, is the city that i live and i want to be happy, so why not transform this city in the best for my life ? That is the right mindset, no ?

Well produced and helpful videos. I spent 30 years in Schlumberger Globally. Midland was and I am sure still is a TEXAS friendly town!  In the 90's much cleaner than you show but the shale oil boom and influx has unsurprisingly some negative effects of any boom town in all aspects and some better respect for the local is needed .  FYI Schlumberger started hard recruiting of female Engineers in the late 80's and have been leaders in pro female recruitment for for 40 years, in an attempt at balance. If you look at the recruitment videos you can see that continued emphasis, but this is nothing new and it is balanced as the attrition rate is higher.  As an FSM in 1991 Mexico I had 5 engineers, 4 female .  You do a great job in these informal videos of sending the message that if you strive to be an equal part of the team you will be respected and succeed.  Is it a level playing field ? within SLB I hope so. Out-with no, but with the right motivation and understanding of the industry and demands before anyone applies,, then yes now more than ever its Male/Female friendly company.   I see some inappropriate remarks in 2-3 of your videos that I watched this afternoon, they do not represent the professional oilfield 2019. Trash will be Trash. Your profile is Hispanic Canadian, you speak French,English, Spanish, have a grounding in the USA Frac intensive Permian Basin, you are Wireline... You are on a great path - Go for it. Oil and Gas will be needed throughout your lifetime , to make energy, materials and chemicals,,, electric will help reduce reliance but cannot provide the modern materials to make, say .. a Tesla. Jump at an overseas opportunity, .. but I am sure they have a plan for you. (oh and put the share price back in the $90s please)! Good luck !",2019-05-11T03:44:36Z,2

Came back in 1983.  When oil was at $100 it was not fun living here....too much traffic and crazy driving people.  Now, with oil at $60, things are much better.  There are still plenty of opportunities and CDL drivers are still needed.  You can still make good money here.  Schools, drugs, crime on par with a lot of other places so not really an added negative.   A lot of dedicated teachers for sure.  Roads are getting upgraded thanks to the decreased oil prices which have provided less traffic and more opportunities to improve roads.    Your quality of life and your income provide a good life.  You can degrade your life with your money anywhere, it's no different or worse here.   It's easy to see sunsets here and you don't have to look at the oil slick in the pavement to see a rainbow.  Out here you can see the whole thing and appreciate it!  Wind is bad and of all the negatives, I have to say I hate the wind more than anything.  None the less, with retirement about 2 years away, I'll probably stay in Midland.....good people, quality people, safe living.",2021-02-25T14:14:35Z,1

The only thing I can say is it’s not a fun place for a teenager. All there is to do is smoke weed and drink. Second, Midland is trashed BECAUSE of so many people coming in and out. The locals take care of their city and want it to be a nice place. Most of these people are temporary and don’t really care about what they leave behind for the people who have always lived here. Another thing is it’s very over crowded. And football is everything here. EVERYTHING.",2019-07-02T05:45:44Z,1

My freind is trying to get me interested in this type of driving (he's in driving school and says it's all the rage rn through the trucking grapevine, but think he just wants my peer support for his new adventure) in maybe any kind of driving work in that hydrofrac well industry,doing my homework and video is pretty informative. I had 13 years big rig  driving experience, did OTR first, route restaraunt work, worked at a giant ltl hub where I moved a volume of 100 to 150 trailers per shift, plus p&d and line haul, before I hauled doubles (it was the best! Or my favorite job out of all)   but got a D.U.I. (was in my personal vehicle, wasn't pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving but had a headlight out and didn't plead the 5th when the officer asked if I had anything to drink, thought I was good for the b.a.c test but was just over enough to make it count,  still guilty so not excusing myself with the details) 4 years ago but coming up on 5 years in July from conviction date.  Lost my  job hauling doubles for 6 years. My licence was suspended for a year but was able to get my CDL back with all my endorsements (I had all of them). I was eligble for an expungement, because I was a first time offender, and told by lawyer it won't show up on criminal background check, and I am legally allowed not to disclose that on any job application for a job that doesn't require driving. (I did check my record and it doesn't show up on a public search, but employers have access to some kind of illuminati deep web search data base) but it will always show up on an MVR, which you have to show any trucking employer. Not sure how strict some of those oil rig companies are about O.W.I. convictions?  Most places want at least 7 years to have past. I have applied at some places that excepted 3 years to pass, but never heard back,  but thought that due to having no recent driving experience and were all local LTL companies (not super gung ho about trucking to start off at the bottom as an OTR driver again)  I was a good truck driver in my time, it's organic or in my DNA.  I would challenge any top super trucker at any oil rig place to some kind of driver rodeo challenge for like some kind of pre employment consideration,  even being out of a truck almost 5 years and know I can drive 50x better than any green driver with a case of beer in me (just kidding, quit drinking over an O.W.I. and swear on a stack bibles I have)  but anyway if those oil fields transports are desperate and pay good I'd be a perfect fit for any job, but main issue is no recent experience and a bad insurance canidate(even though I could jump in a rig tommorow and be right back at it)  but do like routine and regularity, which those oil field driving jobs don't seem have, I'd be bored to death with all that waiting, but could assimilate, adapt and overcome.",2023-03-16T06:55:02Z,1

I am not, but I am of the belief we do need to control border entries with compassion and concentrate on keeping the bad guys out.

The first time, I went in with lots of on the job skills, but did not study the code book to the level needed for doing well on the written exam.  The second time, I aced the exam due to really knowing the sections of the plumbing code that are tested on the Journeyman's exam.  I recommend an exam prep class, to help focus your attention on the right sections of the code and help with any test anxiety.  Looking back, I highly value the right of passage that Roger describes in this video. Great video! Thank you Roger!",2020-05-03T13:19:41Z,1

Once you have it you can plumb any building.  Also for every apprentice a company has there has to be one journeyman.  Apprentices cant work alone until their 4 th year and then its only light service.

It was originally $200 and I didnt need it that bad to pay that much. A few weeks ago they dropped the price to $170 on Amazon and they sold out rather quickly. Ive been checking Amazon since then to see if more were in stock. Few days ago I saw one in stock discounted at $96 because the packaging box was damaged. I didnt care about the packaging and its still under warranty from Amazon. I bought and man im glad I did. Its a beast of a battery. I also got the 8mm to mc4 connector so i can hook it up to my solar panels for charging. All working great so far. Take care James.,2019-01-13T18:46:26Z,1

He always invited me to work for him in the summers. My father, being an immigrant, and coming from the construction field; never wanted his sons to do manual labor. He wanted us to go to college and be doctors or lawyers. So I ended up missing the chance to get into the plumbing field at a very young age. Now, at 34 years of age, I am looking for my entrance into the field. I want to go to community college to study plumbing and find my neighbor to see if he would be interested in hiring me as a part time helper. I do currently have a full time job that pays well, but I miss working with my hands. I feel, if I can get on with my former neighbor, I can get a first hand look at what I'm getting myself into. I guess the only question I have for you at the moment is, what is the starting hourly rate for entry level plumbers? Does residential pay more than commercial? (I want to do both to learn as much as I can.)  I'm from Houston, so our pay is pretty close. Other than that, is there any advise on getting to where you are at? Do I seem to be coming at this the right way? Thank you for your time sir. -Dan from Houston",2018-10-30T06:20:57Z,0
