If you offer actual value to something that your passionate about and or studied in college you gotta prove that undeniably to the right people and stop relying on recruiters and HR departments to ""maybe"" let you interview. I'm 42 years old right now and was in the same position as all of these 20 year olds were today, applied to hundreds of jobs and never heard back, but I finally did the logical thing and reached out to real friends and connections to get me an interview. I took a low paying job I was significantly overqualified for and went from there, even as an employee, all of my promotions or job shifts took place because of friends and favors, HR is totally worthless especially now with AI, and automation.

One thing I would disagree with is AI replacing all work. AGI can more easily replace knowledge-based work that can be done mostly on the computer. But for manual labor, it requires robots as agents to act through. So far, no robot is even close to being as versatile as a human being and also scaling physical objects like robots provides less savings from an economic perspective. That doesn't mean it won't happen, but that means when talking about future scenarios AI alone without more progress in robotics will not replace all work humans can do.",2025-07-27T20:48:05Z,4

Many philosophers and thinkers have written about how human beings have the right to revolt when society veers too far away from the social contract. It appears that by even questioning the possibility of a few corporations utilizing AI technologies to deprive the vast majority of human beings of their jobs and livelihoods, they are already intrinsically veering out of that boundary of the social contract.

The opportunity pool shrunk and as skills that had been in demand became commoditised there was downward pressure on wages as well. I saw large tech firms shrink their graduate intake programs while simultaneously scaling back the active upskilling and training of their existing workers (e.g. train yourself in your own time after hours). This is like that on steroids - it is a simultaneous race to find efficiency and cut costs and it is all being done using AI as a potential enabler but to what end ? The workforce and the education system cannot keep up and we could have a sudden generation of people who were highly motivated to position themselves for a future workplace that just doesn't want or need them - fraught times ahead I think...,2025-08-11T05:09:37Z,5

The real issue is that this will create a knowledge gap—people won’t develop the skills needed for architect-level roles. In five years, I’m confident an AI agent could do my job.

I get so many chances with interviews, but when they hear ""I have a disability,"" I already know in their mind that they're thinking, ""This guy's a liability in our workforce. We shouldn't hire him."" I don't blame them, but I don't see it fair game being the outcome was quite the ordeal. Gen Z are literal slaves to the economy. We want to work, but how can we when seeing barely any openings are given? Our depleting psyche of burn out, depression, anxiety, stress, etc. is always scoffed at and we're always said to be the ""Lazy Generation or the ""Snowflake Generation.""  Whenever I hear an elderly say, ""Back in my day, I was able to easily get this job, so why can't you do the same?"" I'm like, ""Because back in your day, you were given hope in society by people who spoke highly about it and actually got through with their promises, and an easier job market than ours."" The system has changed. It's rare to hear Boomers to have some empathy towards us, but the majority see us as just the worst.

The plan was to use the degree to exploit more work for less pay(ie you’re not qualified). There were never enough jobs for ppl with degrees. If everyone is a doctor why do I need to pay 100k when I can get the same job done for 30-40k. Without exploitation you can’t have rich or poor. How I know? I’m a capitalist.

The most important point they bring up is that many companies plan to use AI to take more and more tasks away from humans. ​But the worry shouldn't just be about ""losing your job."" The real problem is the value of your work. ​A good salary was always safe because your skill was rare (hard to find). Now, AI makes that skill easy to find (abundant). What the machine does for free is worth very little when you do it. ​This is why your profession is going through Wage Compression. ​The solution is not just ""using AI"" to be faster. The solution is to pick a side in the market's new rule: ​The Machine's Boss: You tell the AI what it must do and what the goal is. You control the system. ​The Machine's Worker: You only do what the AI orders, like the example of the surgeon who becomes the machine's ""steady hand"". ​If you only follow the machine's orders, your value drops a lot. Your safety is in being the Boss.",2025-11-04T14:46:29Z,13

In fact, coding is just like the electrician example she used. The faults are hidden, plausible, and hard to find. There is no verification system right now - especially not the AI ones - that can find them all. And if testing does reveal a fault in outputs, finding where it resides (and working out how to fix it) are time consuming. For more specific detail, check out the MERT study on productivity harm using Claude - and note how even though coders thought they were more productive using generated code, they were less productive than similar coders not using the LLM.",2025-10-29T13:47:22Z,11

It seems Professor Chen has also adopted certain American manners. His opening remarks about Dr Jeffrey Sachs struck me as unnecessarily dismissive, particularly given Dr Sachs’s stature as both guest and world-renowned statesman.   Academic courtesy demands deference to invited speakers, especially one who has contributed so deeply to global development discourse. The tone at the outset reflected more of an American talk-show sparring style than the civility one expects of a university platform.  It was, in that sense, a disappointing moment for HKU Business School — but an unqualified triumph for Dr Sachs, whose measured and eloquent address reminded the audience of China’s extraordinary civilisational continuity and the constructive possibilities of its future.",2025-11-03T07:10:16Z,3

Companies will value the curious and skilled.   2️⃣Consider other industries/smaller companies. Manufacturing, construction & care industries are in demand of workers.   3️⃣ The skilled trades are an AMAZING opportunity because all the boomers are retiring. If you don’t want a laptop job & like working with your hands, consider the trades.   4️⃣ Tap into your network. Use LinkedIn to explore companies & connect with alumni.   5️⃣ This might be the year you finally bet on yourself & start your own company/freelance!

I agree, but I think the scale back will apply to subsets of tech like social media development much more than higher grossing tech fields like aviation and military circles. 2. I think we will take steps toward AI automation, but I’d predict that it’s a longer process that still has a long way to go. Maybe more widespread automation by 2030. 3. Couldn’t agree more. Even if the economy rebounds quickly and booms, companies will be very cautious for the first few quarters, especially if they do a lot of overseas manufacturing. 4. Couldn’t agree more. My company is already flirting with it, but I’m a rare breed who prefers working in the office, so it wouldn’t be a huge shift for me. 5. Couldn’t agree more, but I also predict a lot of bankrupt or deeply in debt people because they jump into entrepreneurship as a reaction to RTO rather than an actual interest in all the responsibilities and headaches that come with business ownership. 6. I’d like to see that, but I doubt it. I can’t see most companies putting more effort into making hiring efficient.  Loved this video though.

The moment the economy starts growing again, they hire regardless of whether the candidate is a total fit. If you need and want a workforce and can't find it, you just need to train them yourselves—it has happened many times before, and it will happen again. Not hiring, and consequently putting the remaining team under stress and overworking them, is the worse choice, in my opinion. I led a team (and was part of many in the earlier years of my career) - now I'm retired - and I would have rather gone the extra mile to train someone with the perspective of future relief/support than to wait for someone to magically appear after years.

Realized I needed a degree to advance. It was obvious I should get a computer science degree.  Started that, realized I already knew a lot of CS, at least the basics.  Switched to get a math degree. I'm not the greatest mathematician, but it's a great credential.  Tech comes and goes, math is permanent.  Started programming and realized I could make better, more up to date systems.  Actively studied books from tech publishers, later online. Sometimes needed to remind managers that ""people don't just magically wake up in the morning knowing how to use the latest tech"", that part is not always obvious. This eventually lead to incredible freedom and flexibility in my job.  I always liked the learning part, was happiest when I didn't already know how to do something.  I realize that first entry level job is harder to get now.  I got my first programming job at a non-profit and actually involved a pay cut, that paid off in the long run.",2025-11-27T17:42:48Z,16

Advertising, AI, data analysis, marketing, content creation. But what all of these encompass are industries that fall within the category of what we would call *means* to some other end. Advertising advertises for a product. Where is the product? AI helps with aggregation and research: Research about what? Data analyzes data and marketing markets to increase sales: Selling what? Content creation creates content to generate money from attention either by subscription or monetization: Subscribing comes from willing subscribers who spend their time on this rather than having a barbeque or going out with a friend. Monetization is for, again, advertising. It is a world being sucked into digitization, a dystopia wherein public transportation is unbuilt, bridges depreciate, housing is built substandard or as lofts and multi-million speculation-housing that those already in the tech sector or finance or entertainment niches can buy. Nursing, medical staffing, retirement homes, education, childcare, parks, architecture, art, and basically everything life-giving or life-sustaining is exceedingly expensive yet underinvested, and depreciating rapidly.",2025-11-30T12:27:28Z,1

The WEF are anti-capitalist (aka anti private business), anti-liberty, extreme environmentalists (not the reasonable kind), and are censorious to the maximum. Technically all orgs that are stakeholder oriented are this way too since they want to mold reality instead of work within it, but these guys take the cake and are extremely influential as of late.

Reason is you have spent some good amount of time in your skillset and you understood thr market on what u wanna learn what u have to leave.   This clarity + pursuing MBA at top b school make you highly employed than others in the market. Since u alreadh know how job market works MBA add more skills of survival along with your experience. If in case you are extremely skillfull and experienced who doing MBA you might be ended up landing in finiest jobs.   Instead doing MBA jus after your graduation or just 2 years of industry experience doesn't help. Because the reason for people doing MBA is to enter manegerial role. Skills doesn't make you manage, but experience does. You can be a skillful employee. But you cant jus be a skillful manager. I would say spend 5 to 7 yesrs of your time in working and understand the market. Then move to MBA.  Special cases majority of the people do MBA for marriage profile. And pathetic is even a brides expecting MBA graduates as groom without realising that just a degree can't bring fortunes.

When I was her age we had to go and get a paper application or type a resume on a typewriter. No phone interviews to speak of other than maybe a couple basic questions. I would get so frustrated because you would see a job in the paper saying “no experience necessary will train! High school diploma is the only requirement” I remember a small dentist office had an ad  so I applied. They did an in person interview that went well. The office manager called me and said I didn’t get the job and I’d always ask for feedback as to why so I could fix it going forward. I remember her saying she really liked me and I did well in the interview but they needed someone with a 4 year degree and medical coding experience! Say what?! I went off on her. Looking back I feel bad about that but I was getting fed up. I said you knew I didn’t have those qualifications BEFORE you called me in so why the hell did you waste my time? And why did you post a misleading ad in the paper and your crazy if you think your getting a person with experience and a 4 YEAR DEGREE for a job paying a dollar over minimum wage with no benefits.

The organisation has lost key members of staff and need people to come in and steady the ship quickly 3.  It's a poor place to work and most other candidates have recognised that and not accepted job offers there, so they are virtually begging for candidates to come through the door 4.  They genuinely like you  1-3 are pretty common, 4 is really down to luck.  Market conditions also play a big role.

Roles like data entry, routine coding, legal research, and certain finance positions are already being automated. AI tools now handle these tasks faster, cheaper, and often more accurately than humans. Meanwhile, and while the next two have been the cycle of job market forever--it feels more rampant in this decade and probably forever but mass layoffs from all industries/verticals have seasoned professionals applying for entry-level jobs that are meant to be for these college grads, taking huge pay cuts just to survive, and employers are happy about that since they don't have to waste time training them and such. To top it off, companies keep outsourcing roles evern more so to cheaper labor overseas. It’s a rough reality for anyone entering the workforce right now.",2025-08-05T00:47:34Z,3

Graduates think that by getting a Columbia degree in Environmental Studies, this will set them up for a six figure salary out of the gate.  2) Expectation vs. Reality - In the past, employers hired Ivy League graduates expecting them to work harder and be more productive/inventive. In reality, they get a bunch of spoiled kids who complain about being overworked or underpaid. They also are statistically more likely to leave a job after a year—to chase higher salaries. Employers hate this because 6 months is usually the amount of time the company invests in you in order to train you.  3) Grade Inflation - The Ivy Leagues have all seen massive amount of grade inflation over the decade. While some argue this was exacerbated by DEI, grade inflation hurts the schools reputation and makes it harder for employers to distinguish the best from the average/mediocre. Simply maintaining a 3.5+ GPA means you probably partied more than you studied.  4) Automation - Many of the entry level grunt work is being automated out. Why pay an entry level coder or quant when AI can perform this work 10x faster and doesn’t come with a list of demands and complaints.",2025-08-24T21:59:49Z,16

The company shut down as the original founders had left and business types took over and slowly cratered the company.

The same thing happened to me, 30 years ago. I graduated with a civil engineering degree in 1992.  After looking for work unsuccessfully for a year, I offered to work for free to gain experience, but the bosses freaked out at that suggestion, saying it would demoralize their existing employees.  After doing BS work for a decade, I finally found the job I wanted in 2003. By then, there was such a severe shortage of civil engineers and technicians, that engineering firms were hiring anyone with a pulse.  The problem is there were no more graduates, because young people had got the message that there were no jobs for civil engineers, so were no longer entering into civil engineering programs.  I ended up doing work that I really wasn't yet qualified for, mainly because by then I was in my late 30s and bosses didn't realize how little experience I had, but fortunately I was able to learn fast, and it was a very steep learning curve. Within 5 years, I was the engineer in my department who was designing the largest, most complex and prestigious projects.",2025-11-23T15:24:11Z,3

They are currently the highest of all ethnicities in money acquisitions in the west.  25 yrs ago the predicted indian hopper count was around 6 million.

Yet Everytime u want more money they say go to school to get more education aka pay more. Just so maybe u have a. Opportunity for a high paying job once again they don't place you in a job to get you started to pay off that debt. If you can't help the minority then it isn't something that works out. If you have a 4 year institution and you still owe money 10 years down the line you failed and u are going backwards.  Americans think that it's okay and normal to be in debt.

Ended up working all over the USA with 4 branches of that company.  With only an AA degree, at times I had degreed engineers under my supervision.  They sent me to trouble spots across the country, knowing that I could solve whatever was needed there.  Then 37 years later, I took an early retirement.  Looking back, I think that I could probably have done OK in construction too.  What I think is needed to be successful in this world is a certain amount of intelligence and a series work ethic.

My car repair garage charged me $165 an hour for a tune up last month. The economy needs welders, aircraft mechanics, car mechanics, roofers, plumbers, machinists, nurses etc. The economy does not need liberal arts degrees... they exist to keep professors (many of whom never worked in a real job) employed. There are a few college degrees are worthwhile- ie Nurses, Engineering etc.  Many of the people in this YouTube are capturing the frustration, but the girl at 14:15 nails it on the head.  College for all was a huge mistake and lead to massive expenditure of resources that probably would have been better spent at trade schools... The US has a deficit in annual home construction and manufactures most goods abroad- and we don't even have kids or families anymore!  Instead of factories making computer chips we manufacturer liberal arts degrees.... and to absorb this supply of useless degrees we create government jobs.

My grandson graduated from High School a year early since he put in the effort to finish as fast as possible. He decided that more studying was not something that interested him so he decided to skip college like his parents (who are both high earners (each of them earn over 200K+) and both only high school graduates). He applied and found a job as data server technician with major data company paying $30 per hour. Saving his paycheck to buy a house in the next year.  Meanwhile, all of his buddies are in college with bleak future job prospects due to the AI revolution.

I will say from my 5 years of experience in my career and what im learning in my program, I think that MBA is still worth it. I have been surprised on projects that I work on how so many people with specialized skillsets lack the ability to lead, communicate, and make sound business decisions. Their specialized skillsets are valueable when it comes to innovating, but there is value in knowing how to lead a team to innovate efficiently, knowing where to reduce costs or expedite timelines, and making informed decisions backed by knowledge provided in an MBA curriculum. However, i will agree that it does ultimately depend on what your interests are and where you want to develop your career. If you want a position in leadership, want to be an entrepreneur, did an undergrad in STEM but pivoted into business and lack fundamental business knowledge, an MBA is most likely worth it for you.",2025-02-08T18:21:11Z,1

As a Statistical Analyst and Relocation Specialist since 1985, I'd warn against embracing clean energy ""mandates"" (based on extremely faulty data) and ""smart city"" infrastructure. It tends to unnecessarily overburden companies/industry and can, in the long run, hurt the very economic gain we desire. It's really hurt Boston, Seattle, the entire Bay Area, and other such areas, contributing to corporations moving, population loss, and some of the highest costs of living in the nation. Charlotte needs to learn from these city's folly, not follow them. Mandating (the key word being mandating) so-called ""clean"" energy is a sure fire way to kill Charlotte's powerful momentum. Data strongly backs this up. Again, great video overall. Charlotte Metro is truly a great area and would love to see their upward trajectory continue.",2025-06-08T22:39:58Z,1

Large swathes of graduates with Lesbian Dance Theory degrees or Gender Studies manors (that thry themselves can't define the word ""woman"") is clearly a sign colleges need to be erased. Then companies must be immediately met with a choice of A. All your job postings must follow a strict guideline and will be reviewed by the feds, if you post ""prefers"" or even ""requires"" a Bachelor's degree or any degree other than high school, you must disclose the exact classes needed, and 1 of your job interview questions must be related to the class for the postion, and the company will be easily charged with discrimination and penalized if they don't follow this rule. Or B. Publicly disclose that NONE of your positions require any degree other than highschool, and the company will provide it's own internal learning to develop employees to the company's specific positions (like machine repairman).   We should NEVER live in a world where we have people with Master's degree that don't get hired at Aldi's. Then we need to immediate pass a law to strictly monitor all job interviews and every single applicant rejection should be investigated, every single one. Why is a company with HR rejecting a 24-year-old fresh graduate with a Bachelor's, over some Guadalupe who can't even speak English at a 4th grade level at a hotel? It's suspicious and needs immediate justice, immediate.   ATS' need to be banned immediately, it's discrimination and is not ""human"" resources, it's robot resources. HR doesn't do anything inportant or make sales, so why not make them sift through every single application by hand? It's their job.   It's time for radical and immediate change. Time for laws to change at the rate companies do. No more crony capitalism, no more anti-jobification of America, no more H1B visas, no more corporate greed.",2025-11-05T14:01:07Z,0
