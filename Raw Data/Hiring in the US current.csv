I would have accepted ANY job/MOS from the Air Force, as long as they had me active duty prior to May 1983. The ONLY job they offered me, was SP (security police,) with a 10-month delayed entry (Aug 1983.) I tested VERY WELL = Cateegory A, white male. I took my packet to the Army recruiter.  They printed out a six-foot long list of jobs/MOSs that I was qualified for.  Among them, were journalist and broadcast journslist.  I signed-up to become an Army Journslist, and it was one of the BEST decisions of my life!!!  Plus, they got me into active duty by Feb. 1983 (three months before the baby was due.) I was willing to he a fry cook, or infantry -- WHATEVER!!! So long as I was active duty before May 1983.  Note:  The Defense Information School (DINFOS) is a joint-service program.  Thus, I was training side-by-side with not just Army journslism candidates, but ALSO those from the Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Corps. Note:  All military branches pay THE SAME!!!!

It's kinda a shame you gotta enlist for the military and your test scores determine your service path. It used to be the military would take young men with no skills lacking direction and purpose in life and train and educate them so that they become proficient, professional, specialists in whatever they were determined to achieve. One of my friends in HS was doing the same as everyone else I grew up with. He's a kid of immigrants, they were dirt poor. We were all droppin acid and x, carrying guns, hanging with bad crowd making poor choices. His cousin fronted him Like 5 lbs of weed and he ended up only coming up with enough $ for two. So he enlisted in the Navy at 17. 'm going on a limb and assuming the enlistment bonus has some influence motivating the decision.   But 25 years later he's literally a model of the American dream. He worked hard and studied, got into a submarine after training to beq missle specialist/tech (don't ask me how he got the clearance, it blows mind to think people who grew up like  we did are entrusted with the worlds most powerful weapons arsenal)   But moral of the story is he's is a American success story. The Navy took a troubled youth, gave him an opportunity, nd he worked his ass off and had a rewarding career proudly serving his country and set himself up to be able to live a life of prosperity that he can be proud of providing a life and comforts for his family that he couldn't imagine when he was growing up.   I think the military is limiting some of the best talent by requirements to pass tests and bein skilled before starting a career path. Like this guy already was a welder. All he was looking for was the opportunity to learn and turn knowing how to weld into something that served the country and taught him skills and assets to become something greater. And anyone thinking you don't need higher education to be a tradesman has never seen the the books of standards and rules and advanced understanding requirements to become a journeyman welder or electrician or machinist. Looking thru my friends electrician journeyman practice test, it's pretty in depth stuff u gotta know about code compliance, materials science, safety standards and all that. It's easily on the same level of getting a bachelor's degree at a university. I keep hearing that the military has a recruitment crisis and lacks enough capable enlistees. Maybe the the most powerful modern military in mankind's history should reevaluate how people are able to navigate career paths and focus more on getting people in the door then giving them the options to pursue their passions and specialize their training while serving their country🤷",2025-05-27T11:45:01Z,5

When I went to my manager and refused to continue doing the work that the other 5 quit doing and just walked out I got fired… I wasn’t being paid for their jobs…   Karma got my manager though because when the owners found out I was given 5K! Turns out the owners were a Thai couple. The manager also got fired.   I was Offord my job back and I said no. I teach cricket to disabled people now. I love my job.   Hope everyone has a great week ahead.,2024-08-27T01:06:40Z,290

I agree, doesn't make sense at all to fire someone you've been praising for over a year as your best dish washer, and is currently your only dishwasher after the other guy retired, just for calling out for the very first time with a 103 degree fever and a doctor's note.  No, it's not illegal per se, because I live in a no fault state, but I did speak to a lawyer. He assured me I had a case, and that it was a guaranteed victory, but since I'd only just recently become full time, I hadn't made enough for the settlement to have been worth the lawyer fees. Even in no fault states, you can still sue if you're fired for discriminatory purposes, like being black, gay or sick.

The company I work with had issues with a lazy employee, who during his breaks would close the store if he was doing a solo shift, they had caught him on camera. In NZ you are entitled to breaks depending on the amount of hours you work that shift. They had a tough time getting rid of him because legally he did nothing wrong, he had only closed the store during his breaks that he was entitled to, he won the case of unfair dismissal as the company didn’t have enough evidence supporting his termination.

Picture a day where you speak with absolutely no one... the 'barista' at your local coffee shop is a robote, you take an Uber with an automated 'driver' and you work from home chatting on teams... you have no pure connection with people. You lose the excitement of serendipitous moments, and you sift through life in one emotion of 'meh' because you never feel pain vs. pleasure. You want to make money in the future... be in the business that connects people!",2025-05-12T15:50:34Z,273

Once you have enough to live, what do you really need more money for?  Why are you trying to get more and more and more if you've already made a business?  If jobs are only going to get more scarce with AI, why are you trying to take opportunities away from other people?  It's human greed that worries me the most.  Even if someone isn't trying to be malicious on purpose, they demonstrate why there's going to be such a huge gap between people.  As long as money still matters, something has to be done to prevent elites from basically building a giant fortress and locking them away from the rest of the world.  Something has to connect the rich to the poor.",2025-05-12T08:32:56Z,587

A lot of things are gonna have to go wrong before the people revolt and start putting all these greedy entreprenours in their place.

DO NOT APPLY DIRECTLY TO COMPANIES. First off, expectations of what a CV is are very different in Japan. If your CV stands out, they won't even look at it. Your CV has to follow a very specific format and list very specific details about your previous jobs.  My hiring agency coached me through the CV making process and even gave me mock interviews in Japanese with feedback on how to improve my ""Japan-ness"". I got loads of interviews and multiple offers thanks to them. Finally, be aware that you're more likely to get hired in spring rather than autumn. Fresh graduates begin job hunting in March/April and many employers don't account for hiring outside of that window unless it's an emergency.",2024-04-11T22:41:43Z,1477

There's so many issues with Japanese business culture in the modern world that they don't want to address. 1. Managers from the 1990s who don't even know how to use a computer are still running the show. This is the equivalent of a war general from the late 1800s running the military campaign in ww2. 2. They fill the day with so many pointless activities that staff can be spending 50% of their day writing up processes on why you should make sure your shoes are tied up so you don't fall over or a 7 hour meeting on if water should be allowed on desks, so that no one ever has time to develop at their actual job. 3. They put loyalty over salary. Meanwhile, Chinese and western companies are offering 2-3x the salaries and poaching all their good staff. 4. Everything is compartmentalized within departments/divisions and those groups have to have targets. So there's groups constantly setting the same targets, not telling the other groups and then both groups failing when the other groups won't collaborate with them on their project because they're too busy working on their own project with the same goal but a different methodology to achieve it. 5. The culture makes you feel difficult for questioning anything with management.  Younger Japanese are aware of these issues. But given the opportunity to move into management, a lot of them will tow the line and join the club of inefficiency in order to maintain power and the better pay. So I don't see it changing in the future either. It's like a self perpetuating system of pure inefficiency. And they're self aware that the Chinese companies will destroy them. But they can't change their culture to survive. Its like Japanese people saw a Panda in the mid 90s and said ""yeah, that's how we should do things too"".",2024-04-25T00:20:23Z,2227

I was 19 years old and on our way to visit family in China, and when we were about to walk through the EU customs ATM, a white dude asked us where we got our Austrian passport. I've been flying to China and back to Austria, since I moved to Austria in 2002. We got our citizenship in 2003 and until then, no one questioned our citizenship! When I walked through customs, and I told him that we got our citizenship from the government, he didn't believe me. Well, I told him that I don't care what he thinks, and if the passport would be fake I wouldn't be standing on the other side of the ATM. That made his grin fall and got the hell out of there.

Remember, if you land the job, you and the interviewer will be bumping into each other every day at work and potentially working on the same projects. Keep in mind that interviewers research you online, including LinkedIn and social media (be mindful of what you post online); they often prejudge you based on your social media presence or photos.",2024-08-26T07:36:44Z,8

Pretty much every study ever done shows people are more productive when working from home, but they can’t control you when you’re at home, and they _hate_ it. Theoretically, as long as you’re performing well, getting your work done and hitting goals, they should be happy. But employees who work from home can almost always do that and still do stuff like… run errands, take a shower, hell, get laid. Companies don’t like that. They want to own you. If you have second job, their control over your income source and health insurance goes away. They don’t like that. They’ll fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening.

So he started looking for other jobs and now he is actually working his full-time job making 80k a year that he picked up another full-time job that he does simultaneously making 90k a year and he works with me doing larger plumbing installs. Making one to 3K a week. That's a lot of money but the real trick is he pays for his cars in cash and he lives in a tiny little house on 17 acres that only costs him $700 a month. So no car payment. Makes over 200 Grand a year and doesn't even spend $10,000 a year on bills And no kids. Me and him are going to split hydro excavation truck.

The only way that is even a livable wage is living in a poor/very rural area. Cost of living has surged and people are out of touch with how much it cost to live.   Rent where i live is an average of 1.6k-2k monthly where I live and a car payment is an average of 650 dollars which is necessary in the US as public transportation lacks anywhere outside a major city walls. That means you spend 66.25 percent on your income just on those bills alone. Add in taxes, emergencies, and all other bills you can’t make a living.",2025-08-21T12:58:06Z,25

I have attended a number of interviews, as both a hiring manager and applicant.  Seasoned,  I would say, but never comfortable.   So, in my most recent scenario,  where I sat across the virtual table as an applicant,  I checked YouTube, and one of your videos came out, I played it, your tips included the importance of your background,  your attire etc. I may have known these things,  but it was your messaging that got me, your energy, and your willingness to help.   I know this because after the interview, you and your red tie came up 😅. That is, as I reflected on what went well,  I was appreciative of the simplicity of your wisdom.  So, I thank you!

Even if your boss is the worst human you have ever come across, you might still work with other people from that company in the future, and even if your conversation when quitting is a private setting, if you are nasty and “cause a scene” when quitting, the boss will mostly tell others how you reacted. Granted a lot of terrible boss might say you didn’t handle it properly anyways because of ego, jealousy, whatever, but if you are professional with everyone else, they are less likely to believe the boss if they were to say such things.",2025-05-26T04:32:50Z,0

So this was already a huge problem, and the inclusion of foreign contractors in countries with significantly lower costs of living changes it, but doesn’t _dramatically_ change it. It’s an acceleration, not an inflection point.   Which doesn’t mean that it’s not bad or not worth talking about. And the acceleration can make a thing that was a minor problem around the edges into a society-undermining problem. But most humans are very bad at recognizing creeping threats, very bad at planning for nebulous threats, and bad-to-very-bad at cognitive empathy. So I think the lack of conversation reflects lack of recognizing that this is a systemic problem. Thanks for bringing it up!  But I also think this reflects factionalism and lack of much trans-national worker solidarity to counterbalance the power of transnational corporations. In the US, big transnational corporations and some politicians have for 50+ years mostly succeeded in scapegoating workers in lower-COL countries and pitting US workers against them. Most of the US unions completely fell for this in the 1970s-1990s, pushing to prevent offshoring of manufacturing jobs through contracts and legislation, instead of pushing to unionize the foreign workers. They saw foreign workers as unfair  competition instead of recognizing the corporations and shareholders as the source of the problem.",2025-08-17T20:28:24Z,33

Why? By bringing Google, Apple etc to the USA, their costs go up, so they will be less competitive than those countries that have unicorns and are open to trade (China has lots of unicorns but their digital companies aren’t trusted). India, the UK and Germany all have around 60 unicorns. They can compete by placing people where it’s cost effective (for India this means at home). If Trump goes through with this, costs will go up for FANG etc and countries will start to impose digital taxes on the Americans (Canada already has). This will make it possible for India etc to compete within the really big American companies GLOBALLY within 10 yrs. To start, Google Maps can be taxed in India, giving rise to a better NAVIC based mapping system. Then we move onto search, AI and crucially operating systems. Trump wants to send Indian engineers home… these are guys that built all of the American digital companies… let them come home and build for the World!",2025-08-10T20:14:21Z,1

The rest of the time, I wouldn't even get calls for an hour or more and could just fart around on my phone while answering the occasional email. It was a great lazy girl job.

It's okay to be lazy, especially when it comes to phone call jobs.  I've been working from home for 21 years, and the 3 companies I did phone work for, were so mentally draining. The calls were b2b and nonstop my entire shift. I don't mind steady calls, but not nonstop calls. I would love to get at least a minute breather between calls. Therefore, I would work evenings and weekends. So,  can you please provide the name of the remote job you're booking the appointments for?",2025-09-23T21:07:53Z,1

If the 30% of companies that report later are huge companies and they just got done laying off thousands of employees then the number of jobs created is then subtracted from the number of unemployed individuals.  If 60% said we hired 20,000 people for jobs and 30% said we laid off a total of 13,000 employees.  Then you only made 7,000 new jobs. This data is looking at the difference. I'm sure we did create 247k new jobs,  but if we also fired 180k employees then we only net 67k new jobs total. Even if he hires someone new to interpret the data, it will likely still look the same. Any statastician worth their salt wouldn't lie about numbers.  It's their entire career.

Problem is that most Indians moving here for education complete useless diploma courses from the numerous crappy colleges but still expect to compete with international students completing their masters from top universities such as UofT or McGill.  I moved here from India over a decade ago to do my MBA from UofT and I'm actually living my Canadian dream now - I'm not trying to boast about myself here but trying to send the message that Canadian dream is indeed true but only accessible to the very hardworking and genuinely smart ones that complete quality degrees from top institutions.,2025-07-01T01:57:14Z,41
