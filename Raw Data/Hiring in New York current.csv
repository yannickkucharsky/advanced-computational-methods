Took the job offer from my uncle when i was 17, worked there for a year and a half while going to night school, loved it at first.  The only issue is working with my uncle sucks, hes the type to put others down to make himself look good and can never be wrong.  It was the same with one of the old guys there, the young generations is so weak willed and never wants to do shit, all i had to hear everyday at lunch.  Started eating in my truck every day, talking a lot less, just putting earbuds and going to work, i liked the hanging with the other guys my age, we were all in the same boat somewhat but they were a couple years older so they werent completely relateable.  It got to the point of me dreading waking up and going to work, not because of hard it was, the 11 hour shift and then going to school for 3 or 4 hours, it wasnt the shoveling gravels for 9 hours straight at 103F outside, it was the fact i had to get up and deal with those assholes for hours.  I finally finished night school and put in my 2 weeks to get ready for college to get my bachelors to become a therapist, it was the great 2 months of my life being free from everything for once.  My college plan has since fell through since i had to leave to take care of my mom but im a lot happier than i was then.",2025-05-24T11:32:05Z,12

The U.S. has never been a capitalist country (in the Darwinian sense). Most countries are not truly capitalist or communist in any extreme sense. If anything, lately it has been socializing losses and privatizing profits.  Billionaires are fine but you've got to draw the line at some point when the income, wealth, purchasing power of most Americans (bottom 85%) has been shrinking in real terms. America will start to resemble a developing country where the middle class is thinning out and slipping into lower-middle income and poorer class, while their wealth and assets are transferred to the top 5%. A country is most stable when it has a very thin layer of top and bottom class, while the bulk of its citizens are middle/upper middle income owning most of the country's wealth and assets.  Burnett and her handlers are reacting as if the proposed tax increases will erode the decadent lifestyles of the ultra-rich. Call their bluff because whichever city these companies move to, people there will realize they are being scammed and will rise up to have such policies in place.  Fascists everywhere like to associate unpopular labels with ideas that challenge their wealth and power. An idea that will benefit the vast majority will be derided by fascists here as ""communism"", and a similar idea that benefits the majority but challenges the power structure of a communist leader, will be derided as ""capitalist"" in that country.",2025-11-06T02:13:23Z,58

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

The CA course, including Foundation, Intermediate, and Final levels, typically takes a minimum of 4.5 to 5 years to complete. This includes the required articleship training period of three years. Even for graduates entering through the direct entry route, the minimum duration is 4.5 years.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  Foundation Level: 6 months Intermediate Level: 8-10 months Articleship Training: 3 years Final Level: 6-12 months While some students might be able to accelerate their studies by studying intensely, passing exams quickly, and potentially completing the final level in one year after clearing the intermediate level, this would be an exception rather than the norm.

I've read a lot of comments about senior command staff being the biggest problem. I totally agree. The world thinks so much of police, but they have no idea what it is really like. They have no idea what people will do to each other to get promoted,  to get that special detail, to get that detective position. People would always say to me, ""you guys don't get paid enough..."" You are correct. But not for the reasons you think. I carried a gun, wore body armor and was trained to deal with all sorts of threats from domestic encounters, three hundred pound drunks, meth heads and active shooters. But there is no armor, no training that can protect you from a weaponized administration. The world would be shocked at the things I have seen.  But now I have a nice job and get a check every month from my department's retirement that reminds me that I don't have those problems any more.   All the best, young lady.

The place is less than seven miles from my house.  If you're serious about getting a job then look for a temp service close to you and physically go to it.  Companies go to them for people to hire as temps so they can simply call them if you don't end up working out.  You work as a temp for a while and if you prove yourself you get hired after a period of time.  I was only out of work for like a week and a half.

In order to save money, businesses that fire employees now refuse severance pay and may even try to deny you unemployment benefits by fabricating a poor performance record.

They also have fired several of my team mates and given me their work. I am still required to fill 15 positions within that 32 hour window for the same hourly rate (no overtime).  All of this is happening while our client has told us that they will no longer be posting new positions in half of our territories and our contract with the client is up in 2026.  I have about 60 openings that I have to fill. If I fill 15 each week, and they are only posting 4 or 5 new ones weekly or biweekly, how long until I work myself out of a job?  The irony is that the better I am at my job, the faster I will be laid off. If I underperform, then I will also be laid off in not too long.  Best case scenario I last until the end of the contract in 10 months and then get laid off with the entire team.  Damned if I do, Damned if I don't.

I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt.

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting..

Sold the truck about a year ago and now I’m ready to get out of the trucking business altogether. Like he mentioned it’s a lot of time away from home and as I get older and become more family oriented I want to be home a reasonable amount of time. Also, I have other business goals that’s hard to accomplish when you’re stuck in a truck away from home a couple of days at a time. Already started my journey into real estate as a wholesaler and soon to be investor, and I’m planning on changing careers to become an electrician.

I did it for about 7 months this year to bridge a gap, and it was pretty chill. At first I did app support, which was annoying if there was yet another big bug customers caled about, then I switched teams to customer service for the local expo and congress center and the only time that it was actually busy was in the days during and leading up to larger expos. The rest of the time, I wouldn't even get calls for an hour or more and could just fart around on my phone while answering the occasional email. It was a great lazy girl job. Didn't pay much if you go by hourly, but amazing for the small amount of work I actually had to do 😂",2025-09-15T13:28:05Z,20

For individuals who hold prominent positions in society—such as public figures, celebrities, or leaders—facing the sting of biting and often unkind public scrutiny becomes an unavoidable part of their reality. The constant exposure to harsh opinions can create an overwhelming sense of vulnerability, making them feel as if they are under a relentless spotlight, where every action is dissected and judged. The emotional toll of this scrutiny can weigh heavily on their mental health, leading to feelings of isolation and self-doubt.

Half are definitely ghost listings, I eventually picked up work at a small art gallery in NYC, then finally landed a spot at a tech startup. I thought things were turning around, but it was the same story everywhere. Every place I worked found a way to squeeze more out of me while paying less. Long hours, weekends, holidays; none of it mattered. And when it was convenient, they let me go. I only lasted 6 months at the tech startup, laid off due to AI.  At some point I just hit a wall. I figured if I was going to work this hard, it should be for something I actually care about. So I walked away from the mess and went all-in on aviation. Now I’m in flight school, working toward becoming a commercial pilot. Airlines at least offer real protections, solid benefits, and a career path that isn’t built on constant undercutting.

I did what you suggest in the past and more: I sacrificed, I worked overtime for years, I tried to adapt to any changes that came my way. I learned new skills.

I’d like to add a few thoughts based on my experience:  1. If you have ADHD, it can be much harder to find satisfaction in any job - whether it’s a 9-5, freelance work, or running your own business. You’ll need to find ways to keep your motivation up with multiple tasks because, no matter how amazing one task is, you’ll eventually get bored. This is also why people with ADHD tend to have multiple careers rather than sticking to one long-term.  2. Most people don’t actually want to run a business - they just like the idea of having one and see it as a magic pill that will solve their current struggles.  3. The idea of working on your side hustle while keeping a full-time job only works if your 9-5 truly ends on time and leaves you with enough energy to pursue your business goals after work and on weekends. In the long run, trying to juggle both can easily lead to burnout.",2025-03-18T14:04:47Z,196

That usually means that people will count on you even more and you will have a lot more work on your plate. This can easily lead to burnout.   I'm known for these reasons at my workplace and I'm often given the shittiest/most frustrating projects since I'm the only one who'll be able to ""figure it out"". Sure, they let me work on a few things I like once in a while since they want to keep me, but most of the time I end up not having time to progress on those due to all the extra work.

I am currently a junior standing in attaining my BBA and I am just now taking my first finance course, the Principles of Financial Management. I like the course and with further research, I recently decided that I should specialize in finance.  I'd appreciate it if you could answer the following questions for me:  How important is getting internships while in college? Is it a poor decision to finish my last 30 credits (or so) and wait until I graduate to explore internships and jobs?  Also, I currently do not have the greatest GPA (I struggled a lot with adjusting from high school to college education, being away from home and being on a large campus).

And they had to figure it out for themselves, how to become a cardiologist, or an oncologist, etc.  That's kinda what it's like being an entry level software developer.  There is a big jump in your marketability once you have 2 - 4 years of experience.  But primarily in the application/industry of your current job.  It's very common for people to leave SW dev fairly early in their career.  The industry-specific stuff they needed to learn to develop the code ends up being more valuable than their SW dev skills.  Software doesn't wear out.  New software has to be better than old software, to somebody, if it's going to make sense to pay SW devs to make it.  People tolerate older stuff more, when they are hoarding cash in anticipation of bad times.  It's just been a while since there's been so much anticipation of bad times ahead.  The Big Bill restored some tax advantages for R&D spending I think, which hopefully will help these recent grades.  Programmer productivity has steeply and steadily increased over the years, due to improvements in programming languages and other tools.  It's often good for productivity (if not quality) to alter existing code for new purposes, rather than start from scratch.  Open source practices enable companies to repurpose each other's code, not just their own.  I don't think AI LLMs could have been trained to code without open source.  Remains to be seen what the impact will be.  If there is a net SW dev job loss, it will be the lower paid ones lost.  The biggest impact in tech will probably be chatbots doing first tier tech support.  My perspective as a SW dev who retired early after being laid off in 2024.",2025-09-29T20:54:38Z,24

By that point, employers have moved on to the *next* ""big thing"".  Of course, employers decline to take on the responsibility of training/developing employees themselves.

I’ve had a few interviews. But no job offer. I even reached out to alumni and employees in the industry on LinkedIn. But they rarely reply back and when they do, they just repeat the same advice and say how they’ll reach out if their company will hire. These past 4 months have been the worst months of my life. Legit can’t fall asleep at night because of worry of being unemployed and not being able to pay bills on time or support myself. I’ve had multiple emotional outbursts and panic attacks in my room where I broke my ps5 controller in half randomly and even tore my shirt off my body once. All because of not getting a chance from the hundreds of jobs I applied and interviewed at. College was a joke and I regret wasting four years of my life there smh. For now I’m just going to apply to fast food and retail jobs until I figure my life out. If I don’t have a career in finance or accounting by the end of 2026 or first few months of 2027, I’m joining the military because F this and F life at this point smh.",2025-09-22T11:22:46Z,0

I recently graduated my masters and my graduate research job ended and so I filled for unemployment, but I couldnt get through the forms because for some reason it wasnt taking my fing ID??? Like the stupid thing wouldn't take my driver's license even though it was perfectly valid and it asked me to do it in person. Problem was I had to go to the Maryland office as that was where my last job was, I am located in california now as I need to live with a friend. So im not counted as unemployed. Went through reddit and many people have similar issues as this. So this idiocracy is also why we are not considered as unemployed. Think of the number of new grads who are looking for a job and living with their parents and never applied for unemployment. These are the reasons why the unemployment rate is only 5 percent a ridiculously low number. If you factor in all this the market is absolutely fd right now.",2025-11-05T11:57:13Z,0

And as I was processing the qualifications on the website. . I started to think about the true value of money versus the "" value "" of my moral compass and basic Christian upbringing.. and somewhere along the line I discovered that I didn't want to be someone who just followed orders, no matter what they are and no matter who gave them.. Even if those orders where illegal and harmed good people.. and then I started thinking about all the poor children that are suffering already in our country and the permanent harm that would be vested upon those Innocents if we start breaking up families that are simply here to have a better life and to contribute to our society .. and the resulting psychological And physical damage which could be reflected back upon our country at some point for sure.. and so in the end we would be making more enemies than we would be making friends and we would be making our country less safe.. which would defeat the whole point of being a true patriotic American.. never mind the complicated ethical and moral effects this will have on everyone involved including the family members of the ice agents. So I changed my mind and didn't apply .. My best advice to anyone thinking about doing this is PLEASE DON'T.. THE MONEY IS NOT WORTH IT.",2025-08-09T23:27:12Z,63

It is intentional and blatant. For comparison, consider the propaganda used to recruit Brown Shirts in pre-WWII Germany, Red Guards (now, older, they are the Grab Hags of China) under Mao and 'Corporate Militias,"" under Xi Jinping, the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) (Stalin's ICE), The Komsomol ('Youth Organization'), etc.  The formula is simple: Hire the angry and dispossessed in a society, pay them, and give them privileges. Those who agree to break the law under orders, you promote. Those who refuse, you work out and retire (or disappear). Create a culture of ""Us v.s. Them"" simillar to what already exists in ""Thin Blue Line"" Police Culture, but amp it up into a war against civilians and provoke civilians to attack the Law Enforcement agencies to induce a siege mentality.... then simpy remove the leash on the Law Enforcement against the civilians and let them go to town on everybody. At that point, Law Enforcement is invested in the regime so as not to be tried and executed by any new 'Reform' regime coming into power. The only way to stop it at that point is the technique that Michael Sakashvilli did in the Republic of Georgia: Fire ALL the police and start all over. That became the ""Georgia Miracle,' though he couldn't replicate that feat when he was 'appointed' governor of a corrupt province in Ukraine. The corruption was too deep, and it took an invasion by Russia to start weeding out police corruption.  Bookmark this and see if ICE doesn't exactly go the path I've just laid out. You will start seeing more and more uses of Law Enforcement for illegal actions ... such as using the FBI to illegally round up Quorum-busting State Legislatures for Texas, etc. By the Beginning of Winter, Law Enforcement will be turned on opposition political campaigns, and ICE will be the enforcement arm of 'Election Laws' under the cover of stopping 'foreign influence.'",2025-08-10T10:54:55Z,1
