Dallas has a lot of $10 and $15 dollar jobs that you can get fairly quickly. The only kicker is you need three and four of them just to pay the rent and survive. If you want a well paid job you have to know someone in the industry or company you want to work for. Sending resumes can be waste in a lot of instances because of the ATS and saturation of people moving here looking/applying for the same job. Then you have the fact that people in Dallas are not easy to befriend and network with for whatever reason. So that can be a challenge to meet people that could possibly help you secure employment. I've encountered people are very cliquish, antisocial and somewhat segregated. The ""goodie boy"" system is alive and well here for sure and its not so much about you work experience, skill set or education. Now I do understand that these things are all over but Dallas is a very peculiar place that illustrates things in a much aggressively way that I have not seen.",2019-10-24T14:35:31Z,13
