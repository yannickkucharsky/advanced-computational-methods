Thank you for calling that out. Please listen: Blizzard, more than any other gaming company, has been selling this ""dream job"" experience in social media for the past decade or so. They do this because (at least in US) they underpay and overwork employees (I know this first hand at least in the engineering side). This is intentional! Be Highly skeptical of ANY company that spends that much time in social media offering things that don't matter.  THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS when you get a job is if you are getting compensated what you are worth, and if the benefits align with your career. Everything else is bull**t. You will regret it later in life. PLEASE don't be one of these fools that takes a job because some moron told him ""follow your passion"". It's bulls**t, you know what's better? Getting paid twice as much, having a retirement plan in place before you are 30 and having enough vacation and free time daily to play/enjoy games and other entertainment.",2019-02-15T16:17:15Z,153

The model is all about ""what have you done for me lately"" rather than the traditional long-term commitment that was around when I entered the workforce. It saddens me to no end, and I honestly believe that is why poor management vexes nearly every company in the world. You cannot even call it capitalism, because that would require equal value for equal value exchanged. What we're seeing is full-out corruption, justified under the guise of ""pragmatism,"" which couldn't be farther from the truth.   Ethics matter, and that's what was promoted when I was 18 and started my first job as a office clerk (filing, answering phones, and running errands, etc.), but that began to die in the early 1990s, with the year 2000 really pushing the new business model of expediency of the moment.",2019-02-15T20:20:45Z,26

The ""names"" of the company spoke in that video about ""being part of a family"", being a great place for a career to go, and about their connection with the fans that made the job really seem like a labor of love. It makes you wonder now, if that was nothing but Blizzard actively seeking to exploit the charisma of their organization, and the love people felt for the games; or, whether they were being overenthusiastic about their plans for what they were attempting to create.",2019-02-16T03:31:08Z,0

Here in Australia for example almost all hospitality jobs are casual because a company can stop giving casual staff hours without explanation of repercussion effectively firing them without actually firing them. This is heavily exploited in the club industry to get rid of guards & bar staff who do not turn a blind eye to violations of laws, etc & in countries like AUS & the US where welfare is not great people need their hours, they need their jobs so you end up with a situation where people are indirectly pressured to do things like unpaid overtime or ignoring regulations.",2019-02-16T03:00:55Z,0

This ended up with her working 4-5 hours past the end of her day. She was stressed completely out, my kids were eating sandwiches for dinner because I work until midnight, and she was leaving a rather bad part of town at 10 pm. I kept asking her, then telling her, then coming just short of yelling at her that they did not give a fuck about her and she should not, could not work for free because I knew that they would claim that they could not give her the extra time off that was promised since they would not hire people to do the workload to start with. I told her over and over that they would drop her at a moments notice and not care one bit about her if they felt like it because of the labor laws in the state she worked. Sure enough, she made a very simple clerical error at 10 pm at night, off the clock, but because it reached the regional management they fired her. Not only did they fire her but the day she was fired they had her clock out at five, finish some work up from another employee that had already left at their scheduled time, then fired her at around 630 at night. She had by our records over 100 hours owed to her and never saw a minute of it in compensation. She tried to claim her unemployment benefits while looking for a new job and the manager that fired her changed the wording on her dismissal and made her not eligible for unemployment saying she was dismissed for maliciously breaking a rule. Needless to say we were quite pleased to hear that not only had that manage been fired a few months later for repeated lies to the upper management about why the office was so behind and my wife was even asked if she would testify as to the hours that she was asked to work for free but that never materialized. We also found out that many of the employees who were working just as late as her were being paid full overtime hours because they refused to work for free but were told with threat of their jobs not to mention that fact so others would not complain.

In fact, it is considered one of the ""beachhead"" for companies like the GAFAs to enter the Schengen area. The most famous example of that was that when Amazon got a large fine from the EU, Ireland went so far as to pay their fine for them to ensure they would stay in Ireland, leading to a lot of tensions with the other countries in the EU.  Otherwise, you're totally right about France. I had an interesting conversation the other day with someone from Germany who said that this massive layoff couldn't happen in a Social Economy like Germany. And indeed it could, but there's also a reason why all the great tech companies are from the US and not Germany. If Blizzard was German or French, they wouldn't have employed so many people in the first place. i think this layoff story is only possible in the US or other low workers rights countries like it. But what the employee pay with instability, they get rewarded with lots of job opportunity, as you can see the countless job proposition that followed the news. Honestly, this is sad news, but those people are way more lucky than if they would have been in France or Germany, as finding a new job would be way more difficult for them than in the US which has one of the most dynamic technology sector than any EU countries.",2019-02-15T16:49:23Z,0

If they continue the route of layoffs as a means of increasing their value, it's only a matter of time until Blizzard is reduced into a smoldering rubble of its former self.   They need a change plan, like an internal change plan and change agents / leaders to make those plans work out, otherwise things are going to go south much quicker than they are now.",2019-02-16T01:18:21Z,0
