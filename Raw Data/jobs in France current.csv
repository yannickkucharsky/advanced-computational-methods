One of those offices for EU was in France. During my tenure of a decade with the company we had 3 major layoffs across the company.  1000’s were let go.  For all 3, not a single employee from the French office was fired. Not a single one as part of the layoffs.  They kept there jobs and titles for years after others had been thrown to the curb.  After I left, it did finally bite them. The entire office was closed and all of them let go. Every single one of them, but too my understanding all of them were paid over a years worth of severance.  Those in the layoffs before were lucky to get 3 months.    My guess, the company probably also got sued and had to pay even more severance for some of those employees in France.   Funny, how they can’t afford to pay any more severance for those let go in other countries, but can afford to give a good severance to those laid off in France.",2025-03-04T16:39:23Z,8

J'ai appris que les professeurs devraient tout faire, dont la discipline, car les surveillants ont disparu, que les parents n'éduquaient plus les enfants. J'ai découvrt que le boulot d'un professeur consciencieux ne s'arrtait pas à sa présence au lycée. Responsabilité écrasantes, parents jamais content, et qasiment aucun respect. Ma compagne sombrait dans la dépession, à 3 ans de la retraite, je lui ai dit qu'il fallait qu'elle arrête, elle m'a dit que celà lui ferai perdre 250 euros par mois...  après calcul, je leui ai demandé si elle pourrait vivre correctement sans ces 300 Euros. Ell a dit oui, car ell était proprétaire d'une maison à la campagne dans le Loiret qu'elle louait. Elle a donc donné sa démission.

En sachant que pour les jeunes profs, ils ont rehaussé le salaire de base pour être plus attractifs, mais les écarts entre les échelons ont baissé. Ma femme est à 2500e en tant que directrice en region parisienne, si on lui enlève ses 200e de prime de direction, elle est à 2300e avec 17ans de carrière, donc à peine plus que la jeune du début. Elle est dans une école de campagne du 78, avec un triple niveau et n'a qu'un jour de décharge de direction par mois. Donc pour ceux qui disent que les instit c'est des branleurs, je les invitent à passer le concours et prendre sa place, parce que entre la préparation de ses cours et les corrections pour les niveaux ce2, cm1, cm2, les réunions avec les parents qui ont un pet de travers quasiment tous les soirs, les réunions de direction qui lui prennent au moins une matinée du mercredi par mois, les reunions parents profs avec la mairie, les réunions avec ses collègues pour preparer les sorties, la kermesse, elle est loin des 24h de cours prévus dans son planning, elle a quasiment autant d'heures en dehors des cours.

Donc pour un Bac+5 et concours, le taux horaire n’est pas délirant (surtout en sciences par exemple si on compare au privé)  Faut aussi préciser certaines contraintes: mutations forcées, des postes non-fixes (titulaire sur une zone de remplacement) donc des contraintes supplémentaires, des établissements surchargés et certains en décrépitude, le manque de considération, etc…  Si le taux horaire était si intéressant et le métier si facile (comme certains l’affirment), il y aurait beaucoup plus d’inscriptions aux concours… or ça baisse d’années en années",2025-04-26T18:06:12Z,20

Essayez seulement de rentrer dans une salle de classe aujourd'hui et puis revenez ensuite ça pourrait être amusant. Je n'ai pour rappel que 16 mais ça ne m'empêche pas pour autant de prendre conscience de la difficulté de ce métier. Les professeurs doivent toute la journée supporter des jeunes insolents, ingrats, ils parlent toute la journée à 40 élèves qui n'en ont strictement rien à faire de ce qu'ils disent et qui de surplus les critiquent que ce soit pour leur choix vestimentaires, pour leur physique, ou même pour avoir donné un simple devoir que nos abrutis de jeunes trouvent trop difficile avant même d'avoir lu le sujet. Ma génération est complètement foutue de toute manière alors quand je vois ça, je me dis que ça ne vaut vraiment pas le coup de continuer. Qui aurait envie de vivre dans un monde de dégénérés incapables de se concentrer plus d'une minute à cause du conditionnement qu'ils s'infligent par eux même avec les vidéos de courte durée? Franchement dans ma classe de seconde, mes camarades parlent encore en disant ""le stylo à machin"". A ce train là je crois que je préfère me tirer une balle quoi. A chaque phrase (si on peut seulement appeler ça des phrases) des : genre, wesh, en fait, du coup, frère, gros, meuf.... Où est donc passé notre langue française? Ah mais oui c'est vrai j'oubliais ; on n'a pas non plus le droit d'aimer notre langue : même au lycée on n'a pas le droit d'aimer notre pays sinon c'est qu'on est bizarre. J'en peux plus de l'Education Nationale. C'est devenu un enfer et quelque part je n'en veut pas à toute ma génération puisque je peux comprendre que l'on finisse par céder. C'est exténuant d'être une abeille tentant  d'expliquer aux mouches que le miel est mieux que la merde. J'en peux plus de cette époque.",2025-04-17T05:32:13Z,4

The only way that is even a livable wage is living in a poor/very rural area. Cost of living has surged and people are out of touch with how much it cost to live.   Rent where i live is an average of 1.6k-2k monthly where I live and a car payment is an average of 650 dollars which is necessary in the US as public transportation lacks anywhere outside a major city walls. That means you spend 66.25 percent on your income just on those bills alone. Add in taxes, emergencies, and all other bills you can’t make a living.",2025-08-21T12:58:06Z,25

This is a natural response from an overworked, undervalued populace. I expect we will begin to see more of this, hopefully there will be meaningful resistance that will implement a more humane balance.",2025-05-03T05:09:08Z,175

I think it is a very exploitative practice but most governments just turns a blind eye to it. They reason that it is the individuals decision to pay these companies or middle-men to forge documents so they just ignore it. A lot of companies actually learn to do this when colleges and university requires their students to have so called work experience to complete their degrees. Companies then take advantage of these students to either make them work for free or ask for ""fees for training"" to allow them to ""work"" as an intern to get the work hour requirements. France actually has a very rampant practice of this so it is interesting that france24 decided to report on China on this subject instead of on their own country....",2025-05-02T20:02:18Z,25

Et non pas s'acculer des listes imposées Ce qui traduit un désir de rendre le processus démocratique plus inclusif et transparent. L'idée d'un ""appel d'offres"" pour sélectionner les dirigeants pourrait permettre aux citoyens de proposer et de choisir des candidats basés sur leurs compétences, leurs valeurs et leurs idées, plutôt que de se limiter à des choix prédéfinis par des partis politiques. Cela exigerait cependant des ajustements importants dans les systèmes politiques existants, ainsi que des mécanismes pour garantir l'équité et la représentation. Mais une telle approche pourrait également inciter les dirigeants à s'engager davantage envers les besoins réels des citoyens. Représentation améliorée : Ce système pourrait garantir que les candidats reflètent davantage les priorités et les valeurs diverses de la population, renforçant ainsi le lien entre les dirigeants et les citoyens. Responsabilité accrue : Avec des candidats sélectionnés par appel public, il pourrait y avoir une plus grande exigence de transparence et de comportement éthique, les dirigeants étant directement redevables à la confiance des citoyens. Encouragement de la diversité des candidats : En ouvrant la porte à des choix non conventionnels, cette méthode pourrait permettre à des personnes extérieures aux cercles politiques traditionnels — comme des leaders communautaires, des innovateurs ou des experts dans des domaines spécifiques — de se présenter. Réduction de l'influence partisane : Cela pourrait limiter la domination des partis politiques, réduisant potentiellement la polarisation et favorisant des solutions collaboratives et innovantes aux défis sociétaux.",2025-04-17T10:39:07Z,0

Ils ont 4 à 10 jours par an de congés payés et ont rarement le droit de prendre plusieurs jours d'affilés. 2) Pourquoi vous ne dites pas que cette étude du temps de travail en Europe est biaisée car elle prend en compte les personnes actives et inactives ainsi que les enfants et les personnes âgées ? J'imagine que ça va pas dans le sens de votre discours. 3) La réalité la voilà : en 2023 les français ont passés en moyenne 38,7 h/semaine au travail contre 36,7 h/semaine en 2022 (les heures sup). Ce qui nous classe d'office dans la moyenne européenne. 4) Par ailleurs, c'est bien joli de donner le nombre d'inactifs sans aucune distinction et sans même exclure les mineurs et les retraités du calcul mais la réalité c'est que 74% des Français ayant entre 15 et 64 ans font partie de la population active en 2022. Pour les sans emploi on trouve 11% des 15 à 64 ans en études ou en formation, 5% déjà à la retraite et près de 5% inactifs pour des raisons de santé. Reste donc 5% de cette population à n'avoir pas envie ou pas la possibilité de travailler.  5) Je cite ""les Pays-Bas et l'Estonie se retrouvent en tête du classement [des pays ayant de bonnes conditions de travail], tandis que Chypre et la France ont les moins bonnes conditions de travail. L'ETUI relève, en regardant ces résultats plus en détail, que la faible position de la France s'explique en grande partie par une mauvaise qualité des environnements de travail, qui se sont fortement détérioré entre 2010 et 2021"". 6) Tous les instituts de sondages et d'études sur le Travail en Europe démontrent que la France est championne d'Europe du burn-out. ""Selon l’Institut de veille sanitaire, 480 000 personnes en France seraient en détresse psychologique au travail, et le burn-out en concernerait 7%, soit 30 000 personnes. Le 12e baromètre du cabinet Empreinte Humaine réalisé par OpinionWay est plus pessimiste. Il estime que 2,5 millions de personnes présenteraient un risque de burn-out « sévère ». Enfin, le cabinet Technologia, va encore plus loin et porte à 3,2 millions le nombre d’employés présentant un « risque de burn-out », soit 12% de la population active. En 2021, l’étude Eurofound, qui évalue et quantifie les conditions de travail des salariés en Europe sur une base harmonisée, classait même la France en queue de peloton parmi les trente-six pays étudiés, à égalité avec l’Albanie, tandis que selon une étude du consortium de chercheurs Forum of Future de 2023, la France afficherait l’un des taux de burn-out les plus élevés d’Europe, à égalité avec le Royaume-Uni. Des résultats corrélés aux observations du Centre d’études de l’emploi et du travail européen. À partir de données recueillies entre 1995 et 2015, ce dernier démontrait que la France se distinguait de ses voisins européens par une dégradation lente mais persistante des conditions de travail."" 7) Cela est dû en grande partie au fait qu'on constate une recherche d'optimisation de la rentabilité dans les entreprises qui embauchent moins de salariés pour réduire leurs charges patronales mais augmentent la quantité de travail, surchargeant davantage les employés en poste. Sans compte nos techniques de management qui sont catastrophiques d'après de nombreux Instituts européens et spécialistes du secteur ainsi que l'augmentation des risques au travail ces dernières années. Un joli combo. Donc non madame, ne manipulez pas les chiffres en les flouant et surtout donnez de vrais comparatifs fiables. Ce n'est pas comme ça qu'on fait des statistiques sociologiques.",2025-04-26T17:50:17Z,1141

Comment peut-on raconter autant d’inepties avant le premier mai, que des travailleurs effectuent 770 heures de travail annuel? Ils ont dû intégrer les enfants de 0-15 ans et les malades et seniors en EHPAD dans leurs statistiques!   En France, et ailleurs les travailleurs de certains secteurs travaillent plus de 49 heures par semaine, en horaires décalées, de nuit et les week-ends ou annulent leurs congés, lorsque c’est nécessaire en période de croissance. Certaines administrations, les médecins et infirmiers du secteur hospitalier par exemple, effectuent certainement plus que 770 heures de travail par an.  La réalité est plutôt qu‘un travailleur sur six ne peut pas vivre décemment avec son salaire, faute de pouvoir faire des négociations salariales avec son employeur, qu‘un français sur dix travaille plus de 49h / semaine en horaires de nuit, décalées ou les week-ends, que des ingénieurs partent travailler à l’étranger, que l’emploi des femmes est souvent très précaire et mal rémunéré.   Le Medef semble très doué pour manipuler les statistiques de l‘emploi, refuser les négociations salariales et ignorer la réalité actuelle.  Le Medef ne comprend toujours pas que dans une bonne politique de l’emploi, ce n’est pas toujours aux employés de faire des sacrifices et de mettre les bouchées doubles pour combler le manque de formations et de personnel qualifié. Pour y arriver, il faut faire ce que les pays prospères font, investir dans la formation, dans les reconversions professionnelles, subventionner les entreprises et les écoles professionnelles pour créer des emplois stables, et rémunérer les travailleurs qualifiés correctement.",2025-05-03T09:09:46Z,5

America you get pto but unless you get it approved you can’t use it and if you do they can just say fuck it and deny it right before you go on your pto. America gets no vacation unless your a ceo or buisness owner because they only give themselves vacations and no one else unless they are friends or family, get paid shit wages compared to other countries and the list goes on. Doctors try to scam you out of THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS and the only way to check is asking for a itemized bill becuase here they like to give themselves bonuses by double, triple and even quad or more charging. For example get one X-ray done and they’ll charges you for it as many times as they think they can get away with it, and they will even ADD SHIT YOU DIDNT GET DONE like mri scans, cast, EXPENSIVE medications and more.

I was born on February 1, 2003, so I’m currently 22 and a half years old. I’ve recently started training seriously, and I’m very motivated to develop myself and hopefully become part of a team or program that can guide me toward a professional path — even if I started a bit late.  I wanted to kindly ask: do you think my age is a barrier to becoming a pro cyclist? And is there any advice or opportunity you would recommend for someone like me to start this journey?  I’m 100% committed, willing to train daily, and follow any guidance or plan you suggest.  Thank you so much for your time and any advice you can offer. I truly appreciate it.

Every job is a challenge and a compromise and the further you get out from your comfort home or country the more challenging it gets. That is where Indian youths who have been pampered at home fail abroad with social adjustment in a new society. They are home sick all the time. They should be concentrating on learning new language, new culture, new skills, seeing new places, experiencing the diversity and nature and even enjoying the quietness and lonliness filled with personal advancement. Glad that you pointed out many of these things here. Europe or any where else is definitely not a bed of roses. Nobody is waiting for you with open arms to give you a job, a home or a car. It is a healthy struggle here all the way minus nepotism, corruption, unequality and injustice which you are hopefully trying to get away from.",2025-08-17T10:46:07Z,0

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0
