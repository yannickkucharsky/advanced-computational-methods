They traded unemployment for underemployment, where graduates need to have as many jobs as the Jamaicans from that old In Living Color comedy sketch.

ATS systems have nothing to do with the impact ChatGPT and generative AI has on the labour market and it's not helpful to confuse the two. People have been complaining about ATS systems for a very long time, even before ChatGPT and the like existed.

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us.

I don't know how many times I've done all of this. I can't count the times hiring managers YELLED at me for 'disrupting their work flow' because i was trying to take that step. Its not just AI, guys, people want to get rich, and the rich want to keep the poor under their thumb. I've been unemployed for a year and five months, with only ONE interview. Let me emphasize that. **ONE.** And I was not hired.  At this point America is just a scam. Always has been in times of crisis.",2025-10-04T05:47:58Z,254

I mentioned that I had another application pending for the same org, and wondered if she knew anything about the status of it. When I told her the position title, she told me it was a duplicate posting just worded slightly different. I told her there was a $35k difference between the two job listings.

The federal government has purposefully crashed the economy to forestall entitlement reforms, tax reform, immigration reform, and industrial policy reform. Any reforms would risk uprooting entrenched financial positions so they’re crashing the economy instead. AI should be a boon for productivity but that can only happen during economic growth periods. So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life.

It's not the same as in our home country. While we may be considered highly skilled and reliable workers back home, in Germany, you need to align with the local expectations — including soft skills, communication abilities, and especially fluency in German (ideally at the C1 level). German language certificates are not always necessary — what really matters is how well you can communicate during the interview. Also, based on my own experience and conversations with HR at my company, there is a common perception that many Indian candidates exaggerate or misrepresent their experience on their CVs, which creates mistrust.  Taking courses at German universities, even short-term Weiterbildung programs, can really help.

The idea did not even occur in my mind. In fact I had learned the languages before going there and dedicated a lot of time and money to it so I could actually achieve a certificated C1 level for one country and a C2 for the other.  I don't think you absolutely need that I believe you will probably get by with a B2 level, but at the least you should have a B1 level.  It is one thing if you fled from another country, then you really have no chance to prepare for this, but if you actively choose a country, no matter which one, you absolutely do have the chance to prepare and you absolutely should!

 When I came over I did so with a direct contract, though, I did invest time in learning the language at least to a B2 level when I considered looking for a job here. And, while I have 8 years here, my language skills are far from what I want them to be, so I still, periodically, do language courses.
 Since then, with COVID and the drop in German Automotive industry, my company closed but my CEO collected a few of us and started a new one. So, in my 8 years, I collected unemployment for only 1 month.
 Switching out of the Automotive industry (where my main experience was) took about 1.5 - 2 years of constant learning, interviewing and self-correcting.
 I had a lot of interviews where I got to the end stage of the process but it took time, attention to what I could improve after each interview and a significant amount of energy and research. So, work through it, I'm not saying its 100% going to happen, but chances for skilled workers, with German language skills (even poor ones), are quite good in my experience.
 As for German bureaucracy, I come from Romania :) Germany does have more bureaucracy but I find it's functional and quite efficient. The social and taxation systems would probably not work as well without it. However, I do think a lot is over-regulated here and this is consistent with the opinion of my German colleagues :).
 
 What feel is missing and is becoming problematic is digitalization and quality of services. Most, from state provided services (finance, medical, city offices), to private, service oriented, businesses like banks and telecommunication are outdated, overpriced and of mediocre quality.
 
 All in, Germany is, for me, a lot better than Romania, the caveat being: your family and long-time friends are now a long way away. This is not a small factor in your quality of life. There are a lot of things to improve, but this is as much a chance as an issue, since you can be part of improving some aspects and helping your adoptive country.",2025-08-09T14:49:08Z,8

You will regret it for the rest of your life. Careers in Arts/humanities are not that plentiful or lucrative. This is the situation even in developed countries. Majority of the regretted degrees around the world are in the arts/humanities stream.  Talking about preparing for govt jobs, you can get a government job even if you have a degree in STEM or business and the variety of jobs available will be a lot more. The chances of going abroad will also be limited if you take arts courses. A lot of the obsolete degrees need to be scrapped.  So guys, avoid arts at all costs. Get realistic guidance and select a better career. It's a stream with no future.  Please spread this message as much as possible sir 🙏",2025-06-03T20:48:55Z,18

I think at some point we give in and accept unrealistic things because the ""market demands it,"" or the influencer you follow or the group of followers in the bubble you're in dictates that this is the culture, technology, or method to be adopted. Yes, I went through a financial setback and had to accept working in other segments. But that didn't kill my desire to work with software.

Luckily for me, I got a really established position some years ago and made a strong performance that kept me there at least for this year. However, this is reality. Competing with world wide high skill developers and cheaper it not an easy thing and you need to make more impact as the video suggests.   I feel really bad about jrs developers. Competing with middle and even seniors leave them without chance. As looking at this, I am preparing myself to invest in other business and second options, since I think shortage of jobs will be even more in the coming years.

I am a German and lived in the USA for 12 years, but did not work there and my husband is American. Still....the experience is similar. You always experience a culture shock, even when you come from a similar one. Anyway...to fully enjoy the new culture you have to learn everything about it and you have to adjust. The new culture will not adjust to you. Learning the native language is the most important thing. Germans expect you to speak German, in France they expect you to speak French etc. At work you might get away with English, but when you want your electricity to be cut on or whatever you need to speak the native language of the country you live in. Just because English is the widely spread language you cannot expect that everybody can speak two languages. In the US nobody would expect that amybody knows the Italian or German language. About the handshake....Take my word for it...when you grow up with it, it is a normal thing and the way we say hello. And yes, when you shake anybody's hand you look in the eyes of that person. Anything else would not make any sense. And I agree...before anybody moves to another country they should learn about the culture beforehand. What you do inside your home is up to you, but when you step outside please show respect to the country you live in. When my girlfriend came for a visit to the USA she wanted to sunbath top less at the community pool. It took me a long time to convince her that she cannot to this in the USA. To her it was so normal that she could not get her head wrapped around it that she could end up in jail in the US for doing so. It is really important to know about the culture if you plan to live there. It also helps to talk to natives and show interest. They love to learn about your culture also.",2025-08-31T06:31:40Z,11

I compare and contrast this to people who have spend the same amount of time in USA or Australia and feel more at home there. The other major point of assimilation is how we have been open to the culture and relationships in the adopted Country. Did we marry there, did we raise our kids to think like a local or think like an Indian, do you enjoy and partake in local sports, or stick to only cricket. Do you volunteer your time for the good of local people or work for agencies that help out locals? How have you inserted yourself into becoming one with your neighborhood town/city? These things make a huge difference in the way you assimilate into a new culture OR you can remain an expat and take your wealth and go back to India in retirement.

Since then prices are stagnant.  Now that decade was an exception caused by extraordinarily low interest rates that effectively induced a real estate bubble.  The next decade is very unlikely to see the same growth in prices, so basically up to 2023 it was really hard to lose money with real estate.

Doubling of your property investment in 10 years. I think there was a very special time window in the last 10 years in Germany (but also many other countries). Back then property prices were relatively low since interest rates were high. But then property rose quite a lot and today they are ""relatively"" high.

Every job is a challenge and a compromise and the further you get out from your comfort home or country the more challenging it gets. That is where Indian youths who have been pampered at home fail abroad with social adjustment in a new society. They are home sick all the time. They should be concentrating on learning new language, new culture, new skills, seeing new places, experiencing the diversity and nature and even enjoying the quietness and lonliness filled with personal advancement. Glad that you pointed out many of these things here. Europe or any where else is definitely not a bed of roses. Nobody is waiting for you with open arms to give you a job, a home or a car. It is a healthy struggle here all the way minus nepotism, corruption, unequality and injustice which you are hopefully trying to get away from.",2025-08-17T10:46:07Z,0

It simply doesn't make sense to hire and train junior people when your company outlook is measured in quarters rather than decades, because they represent high risk of failure on critical short-term deadlines, compounded by high indirect cost to the productivity of the senior people that train them and could otherwise be focussed fully on critical tasks, both of which are naturally compounded by AI as an alternative, but existed well before it.  Add the pattern of company hopping that's more and more popular, which effectively means that training new people is paying for their next employer's benefit more than your own, and it's not hard to see why companies just don't want to deal with entry level people any more.  Of course, that's unsustainable in the long run, but for that, see both of the above: in a business where your incentives are quarterly and *you* expect to jump after a few years too, the long run is some future employee's problem, not yours.  Eventually I think we'll end up needing policy incentives for what I think of as ""sustainable hiring"" where there are subsidies or similar cost offsetting measures in place to encourage the creation of early career positions and training, because as senior people leave the workforce into retirement, there won't be enough young people gaining the experience to replace them, and that's not something companies are likely to fix for themselves in the current environment.",2025-12-02T16:43:14Z,127

This means that if you have 50 similar jobs with 50 interested people, in the past they would probably spread out between these jobs and every job only got a few replies. but now people just reply to pretty much all of these jobs. Which in the end means: a lot more work for everyone and a lot more applications on the same amount of jobs.

The issue is that when they fire the educated people and let non-educated people promt the AI, they produce sub-par product. That in turn leads to a decrease in quality of the end product, which in turn leads to less customer retention.  The effect isn't immediate, but give it a few more years and alot of large companies will suffer incredibly. Companies who hire real people with real skills will see the biggest return on investment.

Of the remaining 1,2 mio. people with degrees a third is 55+ with difficulties in acquiring new skills and a substantial number (I guess around 200k additionally) lives in so called lost regions of former industries both in the east and west.

It doesn't look as bleak mid-term (roughly 400k more people retire from the workforce than young people entering it per year), yet that doesn't help in the short-term.   It is such a paradox situation, there is a lack of skilled workers and no one wants to hire the ones that are there due to the economic uncertainty and economic cooldown.

There's like 1.5x or less variation, that cannot be called ""must harder to find a job"". And the rest of the video is trying to explain why unemployment rate is rising (insignificantly), while in the beginning we saw that it's not rising (almost).  My one hypothesis for now is that while unemployment rate is constant, it may be still harder to change a job — it may be less people taking more time to find a new job, so the total number time×people is approximately constant. In case of IT it could be, for example, that companies consider much more candidates before choosing one due to some cultural shift after COVID, and that causes candidates to send much more resumes and spend much more time to find a new job (I mean AI resume filtering stage + more interviews for more candidates before hiring + more remote jobs to choose from a larger candidate pool). That's an assumption, I don't have hard data for this except for long term unemployment that grows faster than simple unemployment since early 2023.

 so I switched to cybersecurity cuz it's easier and the main thing— my interest in IT

Fake job ...",2025-07-15T17:15:04Z,@ramkumarrealm,"Current Challenges in the Tech Job Market Massive Layoffs: Over 260,000 tech jobs were cut globally in 2023, followed by 150,000+ in 2024 and 25,000+ in 2025.  Automation Impact: Nearly 50% of executives report increased automation, replacing mid-level engineering and administrative roles.  Fake Job Listings: 55% of tech companies post fake job ads, with 70% of recruiters considering it acceptable.  Low Interview Rates: Only 8% of tech job applicants receive interview responses, down from 12% in previous years.  Corporate Ghosting: Many applicants receive no response even after multiple interview rounds.  Longer Job Searches: The average time to secure a tech job in the U.S. has risen from 3 to 5+ months.  Mental Health Strain: Endless rejections and ghosting have led to widespread frustration among job seekers.  Decline in Entry-Level Roles: Entry-level tech job postings dropped by 30% in the UK and over 70% for software developers in the U.S. (2023-2025).  Rising Unemployment: IT sector unemployment reached 5.5% in May 2025, surpassing the national average.  Shifts in Hiring and Job Demand AI-Driven Job Growth: AI-related roles (machine learning, data science, cloud computing) are growing despite declines in traditional tech jobs.  Changing Skill Requirements: Companies now prioritize practical certifications over traditional degrees.  Fewer General IT Jobs: Tech support and generic software engineering roles are shrinking.  New Job Creation: AI is generating demand for specialized roles (AI scientists, cybersecurity experts, data architects).  Struggles for New Graduates: Unemployment for recent graduates is at 7%, the highest in a decade, with 30-40% fewer entry-level openings.  Visa Challenges: Over 10,000 H1B visa holders lost jobs in 2023, with many struggling to find new placements.  Future Projections & Recovery Selective Recovery: The job market is rebounding slowly but unevenly, favoring niche AI and automation-related roles.  18% Growth in Tech Jobs: The U.S. Department of Labor predicts 350,000+ new tech jobs annually by 2034, mostly in AI and cybersecurity.  No Return to Pre-2022 Levels: The market won’t regain its 2021-2022 hiring peaks; instead, it will become more specialized.  Permanent Structural Changes: Mass hiring and extravagant perks are fading as companies prioritize efficiency and automation.  Adaptation Required: Job seekers must upskill in AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity to remain competitive.",2025-07-16T02:17:04Z,0

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0

Unlike the US, UK, and other countries where students often stay and work permanently, this is not typically the case in Germany. While it's possible to find lower-level jobs that don't match your qualifications simply because you're fluent in German, this isn't a sustainable long-term strategy. High taxes and living costs mean that you probably won't become wealthy; instead, you'll live an average life. Additionally, there's intense competition, and employers tend to favor native Germans over migrants.   German employers also usually prefer candidates from prestigious US and British universities like Yale or Cambridge over student immigrants with a university degree from Germany. This is a fact. They often welcome international students primarily for economic reasons, not necessarily to provide more employment opportunities. I know an American who studied here,  became fluent in German (C1 level), speaking almost like a native, but she told me most employers rejected her in favor of native Germans. She eventually returned to the US.   So, believing that studying in Germany will guarantee a job afterward is an illusion. There are already highly qualified refugees from other countries who are unemployed here. Many YouTube channels don't have a thorough understanding of the German system; while some are relatively trustworthy, they still lack complete knowledge and experience. Comparatively, this YouTube is genuine, although the guy didn't cover some other facts, which I can understand may be due to a lack of knowledge of the German system.",2025-08-27T09:32:15Z,16

Learn to read write and speak impeccable English language. 2. Look into the career page of software companies in USA. 3. Learn the skills which are mentioned in those job postings. It would take you more than 7 years to master those skills. Do not go to any school or college in India. 4. Try to become internationally known professional on your area of expertise. Try to help the professionals working in the developed countries on your area of expertise. Impress them with your skills. They would hire you.

It's meaningful to me because I actually started learning to code with you 4 years ago—so thank you for being part of that journey.  I strongly agree with the idea that we should prioritize fundamentals rather than chasing every new AI update. However, I can’t ignore how rapidly things have changed. Just 3 years ago, there were no AI tools that could write code for us. Back then, knowing Python and SQL was enough to land my first job. Today, those same tasks can often be handled by AI.  That said, AI still struggles with areas like system design, architecture, performance optimization, and understanding the “why” behind production decisions. But I can’t help but wonder—what if AI catches up in these areas too, just like it did with simple coding? It’s possible, maybe even likely, within the next couple of years.",2025-05-25T16:21:42Z,80

LLMs understand that they do not understand the way humans do. Whatever efficiency is achieved with Ai, a conscious agent is still needed to assess it from outside of the syntax-only system.

I can see manufacturing coming back but it will all be automated reduce workforce costs to near zero. Some jobs like hands on health care but data entry billing and even diagnostic equipment will cause massive job looses. I think any data job or paperwork type jobs like accounting will be replaced in 5 years. then teaching and communication. probably the last bastions ironically will be driving because everyone thought self driving cars would take and trade jobs because those happen in uncontrolled environments that machine cant adapt to yet. but anything that is predictable and consistent will be gone in the next 10 years.,2025-12-12T22:21:34Z,8

Japanese lean manufacturing model, clean new plant, treated fairly, paid fairly, paid every Friday. Can't ask for much more. Prior to this all my other employers acted like street hoods, and managed their businesses like correctional facilities. I remember with the many recessions I've lived through, this ""manufacturing jobs"" can take a hike, and those displaced workers along with it. But now it's the tech workers, government workers...... being bent over, and the talking heads spin is demanding some type of equity and action to be taken.  It's easier to find an astronaut than someone who can powder coat metal parts and assemblies, or someone willing to earn while you learn OJT (same for welding, machinist work.......). I see it, our competitors see it, our customers see it, our suppliers see it. But what we're not seeing are the displaced (and long-term unemployed tech workers) sucking it in, and applying for said jobs. Yeah, you don't earn doctor's wages (then go to medical school I guess), and you don't get to do the ""day in the life of a young female tech worker"" videos.

Germany is a export based economy, in a globalized and competitive world. Yet, they still behave like in the 80's, when their products where the best ones around with no concurrency, and they can have the luxury of treating the customers bad. The products here are great, but to be able to call German customer service garbage, it needs to improve a lot. From small stores to big companies, they treat you like you are disturbing them, and they are making you charity for sell you anything. It's outstanding how bad they treat the customers.

I liked your non negative approach.   My husband was lucky to have found a German company that was recruiting in his country. He is there right now for technical training. He told me there are many people needed in Germany but they have to have the right skills the country needs. But since he is new there he dosn't know what skilled labor are needed. He also told me that education papers are important and have to be registered but the language is the number one important skill to have.    Can you please make a video discussing what skills are in demand right now in Germany and what about ageism? I don't want to study but find work there. I already have a masters from elsewhere in IT but I have more than 10 years worth of professional work done that's why I'm asking about ageism. Thank you very much.,2025-02-22T14:49:28Z,6

I firmly believe that Germany will recover and regain its strength. Often, we point fingers at Germany because it is a significant global player, but we forget that many other countries have been struggling for the past four years.  I also think there’s a cultural aspect to this criticism. People sometimes dislike Germany because Germans are perceived as conservative and expect foreigners to adapt to and respect their culture and language. However, those who move to Germany benefit immensely from the opportunities it offers. That said, success requires effort and commitment. Personally, I have never experienced hate or discrimination. Ignorant people exist everywhere, but that doesn’t define an entire country.  I don’t wish for Germany’s downfall, on the contrary, I believe the country is home to many remarkable people who are patriotic and want Germany to succeed. Recent challenges have served as a wake up call not only for Germany but for Europe as a whole. I am confident that Germans and Europeans will take steps to implement new laws and policies to strengthen their economies, military, and collaboration going forward.  Is it worth coming to Germany-yes, if you are willing to put in work! There are a lot of doors that Germany can open if you are willing to work hard enough! And if people will work hard enough and live through tough times, Germany will regain the growth of the economy in no time!",2025-01-20T08:57:17Z,5

You may speak German very well and have work experience as well as good notes from your studies, but an employer can still prefer a person, who grew up in Germany over you. If you stay in your home country, you'll have easier time finding a job  just because of that. I'm talking about racism. Racism exists everywhere, but right now in Germany because of the job market situation and because of the current rise of far-right politics, you are more likely to experience racism in the job seaking process.

Could you guide us on how to waiver the tuition fees...or please recommend universities with affordable tution for a Master in Civil engineering.",2025-01-19T10:07:48Z,1
