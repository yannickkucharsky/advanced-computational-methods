Then you have to wait and see if someone wants to schedule with you. You never know who you will be online with. There were a few times that the “student” ( older man) was naked and laying in bed. I immediately disconnected. Then there are the calls or times the student line kept disconnecting from the wifi and hanging up because they were in another foreign country. And when I was a tutor they were giving out free lessons. When the free lessons were over, you didn’t have any more students. Just be very, Very cautious.",2025-10-01T02:49:10Z,590

The $10.20 is based on if someone books you for the whole hour. If they book for 30mins, then you get $5.10. If they only book for 15 mins, then you get $2.55. Again, that's if someone books you, or ""ring"" you so to speak. They pay weekly on PayPal. It definitely comes in handy. If you have insomnia, get up and teach. I have an infant who is teething so I haven't been able to teach because you must be on camera with a quiet background. I'll be testing out Ascribe❣️ Sounds perfect for the moment.

I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt.

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting..

Bought my own truck about 7 years ago. Did the owner operator thing for about 4 years until cost of operation became too high during 2021-22. Sold the truck about a year ago and now I’m ready to get out of the trucking business altogether. Like he mentioned it’s a lot of time away from home and as I get older and become more family oriented I want to be home a reasonable amount of time. Also, I have other business goals that’s hard to accomplish when you’re stuck in a truck away from home a couple of days at a time. Already started my journey into real estate as a wholesaler and soon to be investor, and I’m planning on changing careers to become an electrician.

Screw my useless college degree. This job pays almost as much per hour. What did it take? Applying to a job that merely did a back ground check and verified that you are a real person.  Too much turnover and a 30’day probationary period that they use as a (much more effective) interview. Both the company and the individual can determine their fit in that 30 days.   And yes, if you have a college degree, you will struggle to get a job that doesn’t require one because they automatically view you as someone who won’t stick around.

I’ve had a few interviews. But no job offer. I even reached out to alumni and employees in the industry on LinkedIn. But they rarely reply back and when they do, they just repeat the same advice and say how they’ll reach out if their company will hire. These past 4 months have been the worst months of my life. Legit can’t fall asleep at night because of worry of being unemployed and not being able to pay bills on time or support myself. I’ve had multiple emotional outbursts and panic attacks in my room where I broke my ps5 controller in half randomly and even tore my shirt off my body once. All because of not getting a chance from the hundreds of jobs I applied and interviewed at. College was a joke and I regret wasting four years of my life there smh. For now I’m just going to apply to fast food and retail jobs until I figure my life out. If I don’t have a career in finance or accounting by the end of 2026 or first few months of 2027, I’m joining the military because F this and F life at this point smh.",2025-09-22T11:22:46Z,0

I applied to the customer success advocate role for Square (owned by block) right after you talked about the two cashapp manager positions which I did not apply to since there not something I'm interested in, anyway I'm getting sidetracked. I applied right after hearing you speak about the block roles and 30 minutes I swear it was 30 minutes later the recruiter was texting me to schedule a quick 15 minute phone call with her today (which I did do) because they are closing the role by next weekend, I am now moving onto the next interview with two team leads in the department next week and if chosen will start August 12th for $19 an hour, fully remote HOWEVER the job listed did state they wanted people within 50 miles of 3 locations luckily I am near one of the locations. Ya'll please pray for me I need this right now. I am next, we are next, you are next. We got this! <3",2025-07-16T06:11:30Z,393

I'm taking a leap of faith with you. So many influencers give bogus jobs that are supposedly always hiring or that are really good jobs and it ends up being nothing but spam. I'm not even sure what made me click on the video in the first place but something told me to do it while I was cleaning and after listening I have decided to come back and to take notes. If I actually get a job because you gave me the information I don't even know what I can do in return for you because I am in desperate need of one and it would be a blessing to actually get a decent job especially if it's remote in which I don't have to worry about trying to find a ride nor walking for hours just to get to and from work.",2025-08-03T19:48:32Z,1

I think it is great!  In law enforcement they train you to actually believe one can never get another job if they leave... even if they are say 21?  Joke? No joke And I watched it happen in a couple of law enforcement offices & branches. It is nothing for DOC to put down their own especially their younger ones! acting like there is no life after us buddy. Cross train ATF... Easy & as long as you attend a reputable college you are 💯. Only POs as they are required they work 24/7. Much is done alone. But they can see in office what the dress code is & if it's enforced.  Other days it may mean a pant suit with heels. You are expected to be well spoken because you are the one on your dress up days that needs to be ready to stand in front of a judge. The other days are BDUs weapons etc And since they may not always have the BDUs on and their badge. Nobody walks to them and says thank you.,2025-09-07T14:49:07Z,0

Regularly. And the pay is bad in Florida.  I would encourage deputies to get better jobs with Federal pay and benefits and be happy they get the opportunity to leave!  So really the federal government recruits in FL because we have an over abundance of police from all over the USA.  Florida recruits teachers and nurses because Florida does not have enough.  They move and are usually disappointed.  It’s not like 5% of deputies would leave their jobs and homes.  None of them do overtime in Florida, so they can stand to lose a few.  Go West, young man!  Go get that better job that supports a family on one income!   Florida has become too expensive for anyone under 45 so it would be a blessing to get recruited and have school loans paid off.   The Coast Guard is offering $65,000 sign on bonus plus erase school bills.  Many jobs are desk jobs.  The Coast Guard takes you nice places.

I still say Fire Scott Stricklin. Very polished and prepared interview in attempt to recover his image but everything he said shows what people thought and said about him was still true. This was more about Caldwell than anything else. He was more interested in the reorg of the football program than finding a winning coach. Anyone who came to Florida had to kiss the Stricklin ring and submit to his new program where the GM will run most of the program. He is building buffers between himself and the HC. He thinks he is smarter than everyone else and in his arrogance probably thinks this interview went well.,2025-12-08T15:46:05Z,20

Jon is a man who is absolutely obsessed with football. He invited me down to stay with his family over fall break our freshman year and the whole time riding in his car to Alabama,  he was talking about schemes and plays of football. BUT (or AND), what I loved most about being buddies with Jon was is he truly genuine, he cares a lot about others, he's extremely down to earth, approachable, and just a great dude. All of that comes from his faith in God and great family he grew up in northern Alabama. I hate Florida (Kentucky alumni here) but super excited and proud of Jon, and will be his #1 fan.

If not, ""Strychnine Todd"" Stricklin needs to go post haste, 18 months ago. Heck, back to when he fired Dan Mullen for a bad COVID year for not being a great recruiter when he was destined to be a top portal boss. Then, Stricklen could have hired Lane to replace Mullen as Mullen himself advised, but Scott didn't like Lane and craved a bootlicker more than a proven winner. After 2,5 seasons, Billy's tendencies and weaknesses were transparent and many of us argued that dumping him then would prove to be cheap by comparison to the damage he would do if permitted to vandalize the program for another season. Kiffen was said to be willing to jump to Gainesville and there was no competition for his services at the time but that's thinking ahead, which is supposed to be part of an AD's job description.   Strychnine Todd will be the ultimate reason why the Lane Train's next home will be LSU. If they wanted Lane, Stricklin had to go before Florida made its play. Instead, they gave Lane the choice of working with an AD that just wants him and an AD with a long history of keeping Lane out of the program he wanted to lead for years. It's duncically half-witted. Stricklin has hit nothing but dribbling grounders and t-ball pop flies with the football program. He hit a home run with basketball but now many of the other sports are starting to fall into the mediocrity of the football program.   Jettison Stricklin NOW, make a last run at Lane.  If that fails, beg Urban again. Then, go get Jedd Fisch. I know he's not what we wanted but maybe he's what we SHOULD want. He's a UF guy, cut his teeth with HBC, understands what The Swamp expects, is competitive as they come, resurrected Arizona and now, Washington---not Sunbelt teams and he will want to be a hero for his alma mater.

To be a Gator fan has always been a excercise in hope with only 2 coaches bringing reality (coach Pell and Hall we close but no cigar). The track record is not good and for some reason, I don't think the program, based on my 45 year history, gives me the sense that he's not coming and the fans and media are desperate. That is my gut. The other thing is that nobody really knows anything and I do agree with you that my feelings, while contrary to yours are instinct only.  I also think that the program.needs a solid man to head this program. Lane is still NOT that. He's hanging his ole miss team out to dry at a time when they are legitimately veying for a Natty. He'll do it to us also, and LSU. Time to shift away and not look so desperate.  Not going to name names but I do have my choices who I believe will bring us great success.",2025-11-24T14:10:13Z,0

Having to pull out last minute wins against teams that they should have blown out. Bonehead offensive play calling that makes absolutely no sense. Defense that can barely tackle, no lane discipline and constantly over run plays. 😂😂😂 Ya'll just hired Billy Napier all over again. I guess your AD just loves average coaches from Louisiana.",2025-11-30T22:19:27Z,0

I wanted Lane Kiffin as well as the rest of y’all did, and I understand how it appears hiring Sumrall. But 1 thing quickly…  What’s done is done. There’s no sense in complaining and whining about Sumrall being hired. It’s done. He is the next head coach at Florida. Period. Throwing away your Tebow jerseys and taking down gator memorabilia isn’t gonna fire Stricklin or Sumrall. Accept the reality, and root for his success. He’ll be our coach for 2 years minimum. What if he wins? Napier left a deeply talented roster for Sumrall to inherit. What if he wins 8-9 games in his first year. What if he wins 10-11 in year 2? (What if he loses like Napier…then he’ll be fired and we’ll do this all over again.)   I for one am tired of constantly firing and hiring coaches. So I am hopeful and optimistic that Sumrall will be the last hire we make for sometime because I don’t really have another beneficial choice.",2025-12-01T17:04:36Z,0

Also I think people are looking at how some of these other programs have had their coaches linked with leaving and the coaches signed new contracts and put the rumors to bed but Kiffin hasn’t done that. If he wants to leave then ok that’s your decision, but don’t expect fans to be happy when you’re putting the programs future at risk by not making a decision. So I think Keith Carter is making a wise choice, Kiffin needs to make a decision. You can’t let him string the program along for another month or month and a half because of the college playoffs and then he decides to leave and now there are no good head coaching candidates to replace him and you’re way behind in the next portal class.",2025-11-18T18:52:41Z,0

You sound like a Nebraska fan. No one thinks of the Gators as a force in the SEC any more, and haven't for a while. Y'all are above Ole Miss historically, but the LSU is 1) way ahead of y'all in terms of being ready to win and 2) a far better professional choice across the board.   With LSU, he wouldn't have HBC lurking, never mind the relentless pressure from an absolutely - desperate - (e.g. the rumored contract offered) Florida program to find some relevancy. SEC teams are moving to nine conference games, and with y'all playing FSU every year, your schedule isn't what I'd call appealing. The Florida media is awful, and the only fans worse than Gator fans are Georgia fans. Gainesville is one of the saddest places in Florida to be in, and while Baton Rouge has some unsafe areas, at least the food is better and quite frankly neither one hold a candle to Oxford.

What he's doing now is stringing the athletic dept. and team along again for the next two weeks, when the team is on the cusp of a 1st-round bye in the CPFs.   At some point, you have to put a stop to it.   He could have shut all of this down a long time ago.

They are either broke or dont want to spend it. Why would kiffin make a move to florida when they have shown year after year they want the moon but dont want to oay for the gas to get there?

As good as his hiring of Dusty May looks right now, all his other hirings for football, baseball, softball and hockey are and were highly questionable. Hopefully the next School President will have higher standards for UM's Athletic Department. Hiring Sherrone Moore without a formal interview process should've never happened! Maybe he'll be a great HC. But so far, I'm not impressed. His lack of understanding Michigan's QB, OL and WR rooms last year was downright incompetent and lazy. Did we beat the Buckeyes? Yes. Did we beat Alabama? Yes. But we wasted a dominant defense with a dozen future NFL draft picks on it because our offense was so pathetic! Ntm, he needed a billionairess to rescue his 2025 recruiting class by dropping a major bag for Underwood! If not for that, our QB room would have Keene, Davis, Carter Smith, and Davis Warren in it. And something tells me Moore would've been okay with that. And that doesn't include the fact that Michigan is still behind in the NIL department. That's why our recruiting class for 2026 is off to such a slow start. This doesn't even begin to describe the steps back our hockey, baseball and softball programs have taken the past couple of years. Hence, I can't imagine a new President is gonna give Warde as long of a leash as Ono did.",2025-05-05T01:29:20Z,1
