Several cars had skidded off the road right in front of us, and were driving so slow. Eventually some kindly trucker pulled up next to us and gestured for us to follow him with his lights. He led us to an off-ramp where we were able to find and get a hotel. After getting us safely to the off ramp, he went straight back on the road. He probably saved our life that night. An driverless truck would’ve just left us to wreck and freeze — probably would’ve caused the wreck by failing to account for the conditions.

I was local, but I was hardly ever home. The company I worked for decided to expand from a small one covering three states to covering the 13 western.

This is one of the most depressed areas in the country. Combine that with ridiculously high taxes and no one wants to live here. The city has lost nearly half its population from the peak a few decades ago. Many of the businesses have closed and left the state and the ones that remain have downsized significantly. There is little to work and what is available, rarely pays enough to support the purchase of a home. Crime is out of control, and our local government has allowed infrastructure to fall to disrepair. Most of the people who remain are low income youth who cannot afford to move because the house they live in isn't worth much so they cannot afford the down payment on a house somewhere else, and the elderly who have lived here all their life and will die here.

I visited Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Galveston. I’ll never set foot in Texas again if I can possibly help it. I knew a lot of people who moved there from the Bay Area would regret it. There just isn’t enough to do within easy access for enough of the year. In the Bay Area, you can take a day trip to go skiiing from December until March. You can sail or kayak or windsurf the rest of the year from scores of launches along the Bay and all along the Delta. You can comfortably hike year round, play tennis outdoors, bike in Golden Gate Park. In Dallas, I couldn’t do anything outdoors during the summertime. It was 90 degrees at night. I know Austin wasn’t any more comfortable. Stanford and Cal are two of the best universities in the world, creating a stimulating, invigorating environment. Unfortunately, Oakland has lost its professional sports franchises, but you still have the 49ers, Giants, Warriors, Sharks and Earthquakes, all the major sports. Austin? None of them. The food is better, world famous in San Francisco. More variety, fresh fruit and vegetables year round, pretty cheap too. There’s just no comparison in my mind. Sure real estate might have been cheaper, and probably still is, but I don’t want to stay indoors looking at the walls all day. More space just means more space to clean. A bigger garden means more weeds to pull. A riding lawn mower is not as much fun as a kayak. People severely misjudged what life in Texas is like.  So I’ll tell you. it sucks.

The easiest one they found recently, is to slowly cut down on employment because they only want the bare minimum level of employees, just enough to make the product work.  Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

Then try and find local job postings for SMALL businesses. And I mean small. Big tech will replace lower end employees faster than small mom and pop places who care about people. Aim to have enough, not excess. Learn to be content, not grinding. You will find happiness moment to moment, not in large clumps.

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment. Because in these jobs failure is not hard, but ""only"" results in a less satisfying customer experience, instead of a total production or process failure.",2025-08-13T18:22:00Z,916

So this was already a huge problem, and the inclusion of foreign contractors in countries with significantly lower costs of living changes it, but doesn’t _dramatically_ change it. It’s an acceleration, not an inflection point.   Which doesn’t mean that it’s not bad or not worth talking about. And the acceleration can make a thing that was a minor problem around the edges into a society-undermining problem. But most humans are very bad at recognizing creeping threats, very bad at planning for nebulous threats, and bad-to-very-bad at cognitive empathy. So I think the lack of conversation reflects lack of recognizing that this is a systemic problem. Thanks for bringing it up!  But I also think this reflects factionalism and lack of much trans-national worker solidarity to counterbalance the power of transnational corporations. In the US, big transnational corporations and some politicians have for 50+ years mostly succeeded in scapegoating workers in lower-COL countries and pitting US workers against them. Most of the US unions completely fell for this in the 1970s-1990s, pushing to prevent offshoring of manufacturing jobs through contracts and legislation, instead of pushing to unionize the foreign workers. They saw foreign workers as unfair  competition instead of recognizing the corporations and shareholders as the source of the problem.",2025-08-17T20:28:24Z,33

The real reason many have long avoided low-wage jobs isn’t laziness—it’s that the pay often doesn’t cover basic living expenses....................... The deeper problem lies at the top: executives are paid at levels completely disconnected from the rest of the workforce. Whether their company succeeds or fails, they’re financially secure—able to move on to the next position or live comfortably off their wealth. They have no real incentive to worry about hiring, layoffs, or employee well-being.  If executive salaries were even remotely proportional—say, 3 to 5 times higher than the average worker’s instead of 150 times—this problem might start to fix itself.  Meanwhile, prices keep rising, and with jobs harder to find (and bills still due), wages are effectively shrinking.

In many industries, AI systems are now handling tasks that used to be done by junior employees or interns. This creates a paradox: companies require experience for mid- and senior-level roles, but the entry-level jobs where that experience is usually gained are no longer available. As a result, new graduates and career-switchers are left with no real pathway to break into the field.  This issue is especially pronounced in tech and creative sectors, where automation and generative AI can already perform a wide range of tasks that were once assigned to beginners. If people can’t get that first job, they can’t build a portfolio, learn on the job, or advance in their profession. It becomes a closed loop — one that excludes the next generation of talent before they even have a chance to start.

Rather than protecting American businesses, the act caused a sharp drop in international trade and deepened the economic hardships of the Great Depression.  Key reasons the Smoot-Hawley Tariff failed Sparked global trade wars In response to the U.S. raising tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, foreign nations retaliated with their own tariffs on American products. Canada, the biggest U.S. trading partner at the time, was one of the first to respond with countermeasures. This cycle of ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" protectionism worsened the global economic crisis.  Caused international trade to plummet Between 1929 and 1934, global trade volumes shrank by approximately 65%. U.S. imports and exports to Europe fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932. The decline in exports was especially damaging to American farmers, who had already been struggling with overproduction and low prices.  Failed to help the U.S. economy The act's goal was to protect American industries and farmers, but the result was higher prices for American consumers at a time when purchasing power was already weak. The drop in exports contributed to bank failures and worsening unemployment, pushing the country deeper into the Depression.  Ignored warnings from economists More than 1,000 U.S. economists signed a petition urging President Herbert Hoover to veto the bill. However, Hoover signed the bill into law in June 1930, overriding the concerns of the experts.  Contributed to global political instability Beyond the immediate economic fallout, the Smoot-Hawley Act is seen by some historians as contributing to the rise of political extremism in other countries by destabilizing their economies.  Historical context and legacy The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act did not cause the Great Depression, which was already underway, but it is widely considered a major policy misstep that exacerbated the crisis. The act is a classic cautionary tale in modern economics, highlighting the dangers of protectionist trade policies and the interconnectedness of the global economy.",2025-09-18T01:16:00Z,101

Even though the population was large, many people in that cohort ended up in unstable or part-time jobs, which caused the birth rate to drop sharply and accelerated population decline.  Now the situation has gone too far in the opposite direction: because of the shrinking population, almost every workplace is suffering from labor shortages. People in their 20s and 30s are especially in high demand, and even those with no experience are trained closely and carefully.  Thirty years ago, companies were in a position to choose workers and often acted arrogantly. Today, it’s the other way around—young workers will simply say, “If that’s the kind of company this is, goodbye,” and quit.

While these technologies were introduced under the promise of improving efficiency and reducing costs, the social and economic consequences have been largely underestimated — or ignored altogether.  By replacing human labor at scale — in everything from customer service to programming, logistics, and even creative work — we've created a situation where millions of people are being pushed out of the workforce faster than new opportunities are being created. The result is not just higher unemployment, but also a shrinking consumer base. People without stable incomes cannot meaningfully participate in the economy, which undermines the very demand that companies rely on to sustain their operations.  Automation has certainly increased productivity in many sectors, but that increase has not translated into broad-based prosperity. Instead, it has concentrated profits in fewer hands while leaving large portions of the population economically insecure. This isn't just a technological issue — it's a systemic one, where economic structures are not adapting fast enough to absorb the social impact of automation.  Without a balanced approach — one that includes thoughtful regulation, reskilling programs, and policies that ensure people can still afford to live and participate in society — we risk creating a cycle where efficiency gains actually weaken the economy rather than strengthen it.

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us. They are too busy competing to see who can burn it down the fastest.",2025-08-06T14:39:37Z,57

They froze, then said something about needing to be onsite (which was 4hrs away) once a week. I reminded her the posting only indicated remote work and she apologized for it being incorrect. I mentioned that I had another application pending for the same org, and wondered if she knew anything about the status of it. When I told her the position title, she told me it was a duplicate posting just worded slightly different. I told her there was a $35k difference between the two job listings.

But is unbelievably exhausting in reality. A lot of us applying to hundreds of jobs are doing that. It feels like it's just a pure numbers game rather than anything else. No matter how perfect a resume, cover letter, skills/abilities you have, experience history, etc., none of that seems to matter in the grand scheme of things. It's either you know someone, are able to know someone (and they're also willing to give you the time of day, which many aren't), or you have the willpower and patience to send out an infinite number of applications just for the hope of hearing back from a small few.

So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life.

Texas is so big in area that it is larger in area than Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri combined, so it would stand to reason that Texas would have more tornadoes than any other state. It would give a more accurate picture to rank each state by the number of tornadoes each state has per square miles of each state. Just a suggestion.",2025-09-03T01:42:04Z,206

Summers are usually miserably hot, the wind and dust storms are horrible. I've never seen a tornado, but hail is likely to cause very expensive damage. It's flat and not that attractive. Some years its mostly green but it's usually brown and dead looking from a lack of water. The pay in Lubbock is horribly low. On the upside, housing is lower than most places, though not as low as it once was and no longer low enough to justify the abysmal wages. But the worst is the lack of public land that I'm used to in New Mexico. No public hiking, camping, hunting, ect. There is nothing to do here unless you are wealthy and if you are you usually travel elsewhere, like New Mexico or Colorado. Oh and the sales tax? 8.25% is abusive. I frequently make high dollar purchases in New Mexico to pay a lower sales tax. (screw you tx).",2025-09-06T04:14:16Z,176

Colder areas are better prepared for this, but in Texas most people have either natural gas or electric heating, primarily heat pumps. The problem with heat pumps, and why they're not relied on heavily in colder areas, is that they're only effective down to about 20ºF. Below that, they switch into ""emergency heating"" which is a form of resistance heating and only about 20-25% as efficient as a heat pump. So the grid saw a massive spike in energy usage in a small timeframe.

They’re not aggressive and just sit there while you deal with them. 😄  You’re right about the property taxes, but regarding the power shortages during Winter Storm Uri — that was an unprecedented event. Texas doesn’t get that kind of weather often, so it’s not practical to maintain all the equipment year-round for something that rare. Texans just hunker down and get through it.  Texas also has huge medical research centers and hospitals, plus strong healthcare innovation.

Part of that law was that no one could be denied an application if the store used paper ones, if not you had to explain to the person how to apply online. It was supposedly meant to help decrease all types of prejudice during the hiring process. It made no sense to me because if a manager was prejudice, that persn they didnt like would never make it past the first interview.

Sure, they possibly could, however, that doesn't account for training, the risk of a new hire possibly not fitting in or being even more of a pain to work with, and they already have as few people hired as possible, so they don't want to fire you, because even if they get a replacement, that's a role that's not going to be functioning properly, if at all for a while when you're gone.

I had my CVs printed and gave absolute anybody who looked a bit interested. I got a call back next day and had a job a week later. I am still at this company 15 years later. I am kind of disappointed that nobody told me about the ghost jobs. I figured what was happening only after my own company was practicing something similar. It was heartbreaking that I have lost a year of my life because I was unaware and applying incorrectly,2025-06-26T11:22:31Z,2

The Dirty Six, Rainy Street and West Sixth Street were always packed with young people and tourists. I mean 7 days a week! Young tech professionals flocked here in droves. The restaurants and hotels were packed all the time. Driving Uber here was unbelievable! I made so much money and it was fun being around all of these positive smart young people.   These kids didn’t care about politics, high cost of rent or the 4 months of very hot weather. They loved it here!   Here’s what I think happened….. first of all, the convention center is closed for renovations and won’t open back up for a few years. That’s thousands of business people every day that aren’t here.   As for the young people that moved here. They started missing their family back home. That’s pretty natural. The bar scene has either gotten scetchy or they’re just gone. Most of the Rainy Street bars have been replaced with condos. The dirty six is very sketchy and abandoned. West Sixth Street and the East side are hanging in there. Yes, cost of living and the hot summers aren’t for everyone, but that didn’t seem to bother people a few years ago.   Well, that’s my opinion. I hope it helps.",2025-08-26T03:32:52Z,216

My daughter’s public school leans heavily toward the “everyone is a protected class” end of the social spectrum, but the education she is getting there is twice as strong as what she received at her previous school. My son’s high school, also in AISD, is ranked 36th in the entire country. Just yesterday he showed me a homework assignment where he was analyzing translated Arabic texts for clues about the influence of technology on ancient medical practices, not Bible verses or tales from the Alamo (nothing wrong with those).  In short, we braced for the worst and found the best. Austin has its problems, but it is an amazing city for families and for people who love the outdoors. I run Mount Bonnell and the Town Lake trails year-round and it is fantastic. That is what sweat is for and after 2 weeks of running you don't notice it.   And the music? Incredible. Last night I saw Mdou Moctar, a psychedelic African rock band, along with The Point, a local Austin band. My mind was blown, I was home by 10, and back at work by 8 a.m. That is just a normal Thursday night here. The city is overflowing with options and opportunities.

Both the city and its suburbs are not equipped infrastructure wise to be a major metropolitan area and they were always struggling to catch up with the uncontrollable rapid growth and development. Plus the city itself was more suburban and tacky in character and lacked the urban cityscapes and diversity. Austin was only meant to be a small to medium sized government town just like Little Rock, Baton Rouge, and Montgomery with a modest sized metropolitan area. Austin and its suburbs are now paying the heavy negative price of trying to be like San Antonio, Fort Worth, Dallas, and Houston when they should have remained a government and university town. Austin and its metro area need to shrink greatly in population and return to what it originally was back in the 60s and 70s.",2025-08-24T01:26:56Z,22

About 3 years ago we took my daughter to catch a late flight out of the airport in Austin.  Decided to stop by a famous doughnut shop in the downtown area on the way home. I could not believe the decline I saw from previous visits.  Downtown was trashy, full of drunks and homeless.  Police were trying to deal with traffic, nuts and drunks.  When parking in front of the doughnut shop a person would not move out of the way for me to open my car door.  The rudeness from those that night we came in contact with did not reflect the usual friendly attitude most Texans are known for. Have not been back since, except to go to the airport.  Also the nightmare of freeway construction never ends.  Miles of freeway 35 has been a death trap.  Toll roads are only used by those who can afford them and have light traffic on them.  If the tolls were suspended at least until the construction is over with, it would make commuting easier for everyone else by easing the traffic.  In fact the tolls need to be done away with!  We pay our gas taxes. That is another story; how the funds for roads had been diverted to other state government spending.",2025-08-29T02:26:08Z,8

Apply for thousands of fake indeed  tax-write-off listing jobs per week to document in order to receive said benefit.

These include the overall phenomenon called ""structural unemployment.""  Some economists have predicted this for decades because of its Malthusian essence.  Too many people, not enough jobs.  It will never return to what was.  It's not part of normal economic cycles that the experts are so fond of citing. It's exacerbated by AI and robotics.  Unless the government was proactive in planning to make society more socialistic, and improving conditions for citizens, then it's a down hill slide towards a plutocracy. Unfortunately that's the widening chasm between the rich and the poor, leaving the mid-class in tatters trying to maintain their standard of living in a country where the average person is involved in a non-consensual relationship with an economy hell bent on fleecing the shit out of people.  The automobile is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on a populace. Just add up all the costs inherent in the operation of your car and hang up and drive.  The fender bender industry wants you on your phone, with headlights unique to each model and absurd prices for injection molded parts with insane margins. Back to the acyclic economic milieu in which we exist.  The end of the petroleum age means that we are seeing prices rise based on a truer calculation of embedded costs.   The slow death of urban core retail means that commercial real estate is getting shitty, and that sector has anchored funds and such for years.   Bankers are slow to adjust. Every company is squeezing everything for revenue, meaning the firings and the terrible job market are the tip of the iceberg. The guy who got voted in isn't doing anything to help you folks that believed the rhetoric.  He just wants to aggrandize himself and his cronies by reviving the polluting of our country while bad mouthing renewable energy because of its effect on the ""landscape.""   Since when has he given a shit about the natural world? Has he visited an open pit mine recently.  He has doubled his net worth over the last 6-18 months, while most US citizens are suffering.   Make no mistake: He doesn't give a shit about any of us, unless you're part of the war machine dominated by the Big 5 and go to Davos or Tetons.   Over Easter he dismissed us all and said ""just enjoy your life"" in a display of such callous indifference the average person's plight as to be obscene. He has begun to take away the basic right to free speech and his attacks on people smarter than he is who criticize what is happening is truly frightening.  We should all be very concerned and petition our generally greedy representatives who are often focused on their own inside information making their assisted stock market picks way easier. Stop attacking people who you might call liberal and understand that it will require all of us to find accord and quorum to achieve any progress.   Infighting and factionalism will be our downfall.",2025-09-08T00:43:25Z,11

When the pandemic restrictions lifted, commercial real estate companies were finally able to raise rents to recover their losses. Simultaneously, many tech firms sought to exit their 10-year office leases as remote work allowed them to save significantly on expenses. Unfortunately, the commercial real estate companies won several court cases, leaving tech firms burdened with rising rents for vacant office spaces. This situation prompted mass layoffs and enforced return-to-office mandates. Executives at leading tech companies were unwilling to accept a minor pay cut to retain their workforce. Instead, they prioritized short-term profits over the wellbeing of their employees.",2025-05-28T19:39:16Z,92

Sometimes I regret having not figured out tech was the right career choice before the mass layoffs / shift started, but I forget that a lot of companies did over-hire in the period prior to this, so it might not have necessarily led to long-term security, even after getting a foot in the door. I guess the only way to ensure that is to develop your expertise and have a good overall career strategy, along with some good fortune - even if the climate is tough.  I'm also a bit jaded by the concept of companies as 'families', which has never really been true - that's usually to get your buy-in but without the reciprocal part of actual families which is that you don't chuck your family members under the bus to save yourself or make more profit. It's disappointing that DEI is collateral in this as well, which as you say highlights that it often wasn't an actual core value but rather a flimsy policy that follows the market/administration at the time. You'd hope that the right companies hold values (whatever our view of them) for their own intrinsic merit, but often that's not the case.",2025-05-29T13:08:00Z,12

Simple task like this and even crafting code for a function etc would bring smile to face after it worked ( the thinking part ). Now such silly mistake are caught by AI prompt instantly, Every function code can be written and refactored by AI. Software engineering has move a whole level up, the lower level where most of the thinking and 'writing code' used to be is no longer there. As a result, Client/team-lead now expect us to churn out 1000s of lines of AI assisted code and churn out features at the rate, when previously every feature used to be a journey in itself with learned ( or googled ) code and puzzle solving. As a result, the whole 'coding' part of software engineering ( atleast 90% anyway ) no longer feels like  a challenging job and thinking is relegated to AI.

And those things are nowhere near what defined a software engineer 40 years ago, not just because of the change in languages being used, but the breadth of knowledge that was part of the definition.   The technical definition of software engineer is someone who understands how to create software to implement solutions to problems on various types of systems.  That is far more than knowing a programming language.     All of this happened because web programming took off and there was a need for a large number of developers to create web applications.  And as the evolution of web programming technologies took place with the development of new languages, protocols, mobile devices and frameworks, the need for large numbers of programmers stayed high to handle the transition to new ways of doing things.     But all of this forced a more specialized definition of software development in education that is often focused on more on what is current and trendy vs the basics of software and engineering.   And now, most programming is not super complex and involves knowledge of html, java script and some combination of frameworks and certainly doesn't justify huge salaries to go along with it.   So as the economy has changed and easy money dried up due to rising interest rates, corporations have had to trim the fat.   Not to mention all the money is in AI now, so unless you are doing anything related to AI, the money isn't really flowing in.  On top of that you have a ""global market"" now for employment with people all over the world competing for the same jobs, which the industry also wants to have access to for their ideas to potentially profit from.  And of course, many of those developers are cheaper than those in the US.   So it is easier to justify hiring offshore programmers to do commodity web applications as you aren't really doing anything super sophisticated in the first place vs pretending those apps need high paid ""software engineers"" to build and maintain.",2025-06-26T19:25:31Z,2

I think a black migration take 2 needs to happen and it shouldn’t be to any of the “traditional black cities”.  I think 100s of thousands should look to relocate to either upstate New York, Delaware county PA, Chester county PA, Western Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, or all of the above.  I think Black American professionals and their extended families need to move at one time and restart and rebuild safe respectful communities there.  Inside the safety of democratically controlled states.  Get away from these gerrymandered toxic maga states who poison us, steal our votes and refuse to hire us.  If in large numbers Black Americans repopulate North East America the number of Representatives fit those blue states will go up.  That’s how Black Americans can make the Democratic Party listen and actually forge policies that help our communities.  But if we keep trying to hold on to the south, living in these Republican controlled states we will economically, politically and sadly literally die because that’s what they want.",2025-08-21T22:36:12Z,18

In 1980, you could buy a house ($47,000) on a minimum wage ($3.10 per hour). Rent was an average of $243 per month. Groceries was $40 a week/$160 per month.  In 2025, the cost to buy a house is 9.8 times what it was in 1980, at a national average of $417,000. Yet minimum wage is only $7.25 an hour, up from $3.10 per hour. It used to be $80,000 per year was considered middle class; now middle class is $185,000.  Point is, the old thinking is for an old age. The Industral Age has given way to the Information Age, and no longer do the old ways work, simply because the old ways has put way too many people in a hole they will never get out of.  Minimum yearly salary is not $35,000 anymore, for even entry-level. My guess is that minimum yearly salary should be around $50,000 per year.

Eventhough the biggest reason for the 2008 crash was years of easy mortgage qualifications, which lead up to people not being able to pay their mortgages. This time it may not be for the same reasons of more houses on the market, but rising # of houses on market is a clear indicator that we could be heading for another crash. Its still because people are finding it harder to pay their mortgages but for other factors: higher mortgage costs due to several years of higher interest , higher property taxes,.higher insurance costs ( due to more flooding, fires.etc), over abundance of investor companies buying up homes, home price increases due to pandemic, loss of jobs, less people being able to  buy 2nd homes and slowdown in people being able to afford as many if any vacations. All in all people are paying way over their means for housing. Home ownership costs are too high. A correction is coming and possibly a crash.",2025-06-13T16:31:04Z,9

It's a different focus for a new 21st century world concerned with climate change and creating housing affordable for those seeking an urbanized suburban experience without the higher levels of traffic and congestion. They could also provide opportunities for retrofitting older homes and subdivisions with carbon neutral infrastructure.

Now, whenever I find a job listing I go to the company website and see if I can find the job listing. I finally found a job, though it is part time, and they keep asking people if they want to leave early and reduce hours on the schedule.

Companies will value the curious and skilled.   2️⃣Consider other industries/smaller companies. Manufacturing, construction & care industries are in demand of workers.   3️⃣ The skilled trades are an AMAZING opportunity because all the boomers are retiring. If you don’t want a laptop job & like working with your hands, consider the trades.   4️⃣ Tap into your network. Use LinkedIn to explore companies & connect with alumni.   5️⃣ This might be the year you finally bet on yourself & start your own company/freelance!

I agree, but I think the scale back will apply to subsets of tech like social media development much more than higher grossing tech fields like aviation and military circles. 2. I think we will take steps toward AI automation, but I’d predict that it’s a longer process that still has a long way to go. Maybe more widespread automation by 2030. 3. Couldn’t agree more. Even if the economy rebounds quickly and booms, companies will be very cautious for the first few quarters, especially if they do a lot of overseas manufacturing. 4. Couldn’t agree more. My company is already flirting with it, but I’m a rare breed who prefers working in the office, so it wouldn’t be a huge shift for me. 5. Couldn’t agree more, but I also predict a lot of bankrupt or deeply in debt people because they jump into entrepreneurship as a reaction to RTO rather than an actual interest in all the responsibilities and headaches that come with business ownership. 6. I’d like to see that, but I doubt it. I can’t see most companies putting more effort into making hiring efficient.  Loved this video though.

I strongly agree with the idea that we should prioritize fundamentals rather than chasing every new AI update. However, I can’t ignore how rapidly things have changed. Just 3 years ago, there were no AI tools that could write code for us. Back then, knowing Python and SQL was enough to land my first job. Today, those same tasks can often be handled by AI.  That said, AI still struggles with areas like system design, architecture, performance optimization, and understanding the “why” behind production decisions.

My security company lost it's highest paying contract in the Austin area. I kept my job with the company by leveraging the 14 years I have been employed by them. I have a new post. But my wage took a hit and so did my hours did too. But I look at it this way. I still have a job. Many of my co-workers are fucked completely. One young man who voted for Trump after watching his interviews on Joe Rogan had his last day today. Two maybe three people from the 33 man crew got a position from my company.   I have been warning people about Trump since 2016. No one listened. Trump kept saying the worst possible shit. People voted for him anyway. Now I am just trying to survive.,2025-09-06T08:00:40Z,4

Something is clearly breaking under the surface.  But here’s the twist: layoffs are still historically low, so the unemployment rate hasn’t moved much. At the same time, GDP growth and stock prices are still high. That’s why it doesn’t feel like a recession yet.  The impact I’m watching most closely is on housing. As job losses pick up and more households are forced to sell, housing demand will crack further. We’re already seeing a housing recession in half the U.S.—with values dropping in places like Florida, Texas, and Arizona. The question is: how long before the pain spreads to other states?  👉 Head to Reventure App  to track the data in your ZIP code. Pay close attention to inventory—if it’s spiking in your market, that’s a leading sign the recession is already underway, and cheaper home prices could be just around the corner.

It's better to drop first and most, than risk being underwater on mortgage. 3.

I believe they are still price gouging under the cover of general inflation. There are also few good places left to put all the cash that companies have accumulated while they were gouging during the pandemic so that money is going to the market. Consumers are spending more but buying less that's why it appears that consumers are ignoring inflation. They just have to keep paying more for the things they need to buy. I think if you look at it by category that discretionary spending is down for everyone but the very wealthy. The very wealthy are spending more because their wealth keeps going up. That spending at the very top is also making this look like average consumers are better off then they are.,2025-10-04T11:44:44Z,2

I think its important for people to humble themselves and admit their own gaps in knowledge. Some people ive met think they deserve the most without even knowing the minimum. Its almost delusional.

The reason why you're perception of developers is that they're not technical enough is because for the last 15+ years the industry has pushed money into nothing but web apps and had a de-emphasis on hardcore computer engineering.    Now that the market is less liquid in terms of broad based investments companies are focusing dollars into he truly difficult tasks.

Even the intrest on debt is covered by more borrowing and is now even surpasing the defence budget. The population is even allowing the debt to increase with another 4-5 trilion for the only purpose to borrow more money to ease the tax burden for the top earners, and even raise it for those who makes less. This is a death spiral and now US debt equates to more than 100.000 USD per capita or 320.000 per average household. That is not including possible morgage, car loans, student loans, medical debt or creditcard debt which is now totaling 1.2 trillion.

I put everything I had down on my home in 2021 so I would have a lower pmt( I put down 42%) I love my house- it gives me peace of mind.  In order to afford my holistic health care, I have zero subscriptions, keep my heat at 64 degrees in the winter, never eat out, shop for a better deal each time insurance companies send out renewals at a higher rate.  I work at home so I have no travel or clothes expense.  My cell phone is on my sons plan, so I only pay $10/month.  I haul my garbage to my sons house, my cell phone is 5 years old, my computer is 9 years old.  Only eat out twice a year- my son takes me out for mothers day and my birthday.  In between, I only buy pizza takeout twice a year- nothing else. I cook from scratch.   I get my hair cut every other month along with a basic pedicure( not a luxury- left leg was injured in an auto accident so I cant reach my left foot) I color my own hair every 6 wks with a natural tint- less than $8 each time. I don;t wear jewelry, little makeup and no nail polish.  My neighbor pays a man called Kevin to have my grass cut on one side that borders her lawn ,so I bake for her since she has no family.  Kevin is retired and had a stroke so I also bake for him.  He loves the baked goods so much he comes on my property and uses a weed whacker to take care of weeds.  Probably not a savings since I use all organic ingredients and I bake for every holiday, 8 times a year but then I am not calculating tit for tat. I go to free concerts in the park , city council meetings and family gatherings in order to get out several times a month.  I cant afford a dog with proper vet care, grooming and providing REAL food, so I feed, water and provide housing for the feral cats (racoons visit sometimes) I buy a highly nutritious kibble with MEAT as first ingredient and put out leftovers which the animals love.  Nothing goes to waste.  The high quality products that I love can be ordered at Walmart online- they don't carry these items in the store.  I buy my meat from a local rancher -free range, grass fed-grain finished at a much lower price than Whole Foods. Vacations are only dreams. Because of all of this, even though I haven't had a raise in 3 yrs, ( Mgt can still hire for less than they pay me) I am able to support my favorite charities, slowly fix up my house and stock pile for uncertain days.  I have a business ready to start this summer.  I also have invested in commodities since 2009.  If my commodities keep on rising , I am hoping to finally quit my job and work my business part time next year.",2025-06-06T03:29:24Z,7

First of all, they've completely ignored the elephant in the room. Companies are hedging their bets towards accelerated automation with A.I., whether the predictions pan out or not, hence  the precarious hiring processes. It's all over the news. This doesn't represent the entirety of the problem, but it definitely shouldn't be ignored. The harsh reality is that employees are a financial liability and a necessary evil to business owners, and if a cheaper, more reliable option exists, they will be foaming at the mouth to take it. If you look at the trend of entry level roles requiring say, 8 years of experience for example, that's a tell to indicate they might be automating away the 'true' entry level roles to A.I. So really, these are not entry level roles at all.  Second, Mitch did make a great point about not posting TikTok videos like this. Granted, it's a bad look and I totally agree that it's cringe, but let's be real, social media is so saturated with these videos anymore, nobody cares, really.  And the way we consume media is constantly changing. In 50 years TikTok will probably be replaced with something else ten times over, so the stuff people post today will go the way of polaroid photos, stuffed in a shoebox somewhere, or the digital equivalent. Sure, it's out there. But really, who cares?    Third, farming college graduates into the restaurant industry is probably a bad idea. The whole reason people go to college is so that they can get a professional job that pays a salary and benefits, and have a shot at an actual career trajectory. Part of what causes career stagnation is not landing a job in their field right out of the gate. The more time that passes before they get that first job, the wider the skills gap grows, and the less likely they'll ever escape the gig work grind. So yeah, spending a couple of years waiting tables when you have a degree in engineering could be the death nail for your career. Your education continues with that first job, and without it, you fall behind. That's why internships are such an essential component of the career ladder. You need to keep your education fresh, and if you take too long of a break, it's over.   Lastly, people who quit their job without another one lined up were probably in the wrong job in the first place. Their physical and mental health are likely in the toilet from burnout, so they are in total fight or flight mode. Going to work is becoming physically painful for them. Something like 80% of people are either not satisfied or actively disengaged with their work as it is. If you would rather starve than continue to go to work, that could be a symptom of a much larger and systemic problem. Anyone who can sit there and say, 'Don't quit your job without another one lined up', maybe has some survivorship bias. They're probably one of the lucky few who are actually satisfied with their position in life. I don't necessarily think it's bad advice, but anyone who is set in their mind on quitting their job without a fallback position is already so far gone that simply telling them not to quit is just pushing them to do it all that much faster. It's like reverse psychology. By saying don't jump, you're basically daring them to do it. I just think that a little more validation and understanding for people in this situation is in order here.",2025-06-11T19:41:45Z,9

As a local DFW company, we've worked with countless new homeowners right after they move in. One of the best ""first upgrades"" we see people do to make their new house feel truly finished is to get the garage floor coated. It protects the concrete from the start and makes a huge difference in keeping dust and dirt from getting tracked into the home.  Thanks for sharing such great local insights!

Government refuses to deal with it's almost unmanageable debt. Bankruptcies, foreclosures, repossessions, and job losses are all rising. American consumers owe too much money and how many are one paycheck away from disaster? America used to be a preferred trading partner. Trump has alienated every country on the planet. Countries will avoid doing business with America at all costs, and only do business with America when they have no other option. Global Trade is completely realigning now. When new supply chains have been created away from America, do you think they will switch back? Ask soybean farmers if they ever recovered from Trump's first term tariffs on China? Their markets went to Brazil. What Trump has done to alienate Canada will have huge negative future implications, long term.   The GOP is now bragging about their tax increase(Tariffs). That's a first for the GOP.  Who do you think feels the cost of the tariffs more?  The average American or Billionaires?  No brainer, but the Billionaires got the tax break, so where does any of this governments economic policy make sense?  As recently as 4 days ago the President said we have the hottest economy ever and are the envy of the world. Today he says it'll be really good next year.

It’s labor intensive and you have to understand chemistry while battling the county inspectors from shutting down the pools due to nasty people who don’t wipe their asses correctly and pissing in the water while they splash around. Can’t be below a 2 on chlorine and can’t be higher than a 10. Ph can’t be below 7.3 and no higher than 7.8. Conditioner can’t be higher than 100 and if it’s too low the sun literally kills the chlorine. It acts like sunscreen. I like it because it serves the community. I just hate the people now so I find it to be a burden now. I do it 6 days a week and barely clean $4700-$4900. I’m always tired asf and have super haters at apartments and HOA’s who try to get me fired by messing with emergency shut offs. Managers who lie about your work and forces you to take pictures after each pool because they’re always coming for your neck. I’m also a white guy and where I’m working at it’s like seeing a damn unicorn. I almost never see other white faces. I get a lot of evil eye and mad dawg looks 😂,2025-08-24T17:21:42Z,3

I shouldn't be driving but I'm homeless in my car.  All it takes js a cop having a bad day to end my life and no one would know or care.  Society would blame me prolly.

He said that I had plenty of experience and that I didn't have any issues there.  He said it was because I didn't ""smile enough during the interview"".  He said I seem too serious and that I might be too authoritarian in working with people.   I'm glad he called me back and gave that feedback, but I don't feel like I'm that type of person.  At least he called me back because most companies obviously don't do that very often and just send a rejection email.

I apologize for the way this was handled. It really wasn’t anything with your experience. It was an issue with our own internal processes and a reevaluation of what we needed.

While all of that is true, its true now and it might not be true next year or the year after. This will cycle back to a positive hiring market, the question is to what degree and how fast. If you have a job keep it, now is a horrible time for a move. The economy is recovering from years of covid, high inflation and whack a mole tariffs.

Work as hard as you can to be one of them. If you've never researched the companies you're applying to, now is the time to start. One of the jobs I've gotten was because I researched the company thoroughly and talked with the CEO about some of the articles he had written. They had one opening, but hired two people. I got the ""extra"" job.  This will cycle back around. Job searches themselves have changed forever, but the search environment is always a cycle of up, followed by down, followed by up again.

I found a job in early September that's on the lower end of what I would accept for a salary, but it checks all of the boxes.  And it isn't another ""contract"" position, I was hired on directly which is a blessing from the heavens.  It probably helps that I work for a smaller company that (loosely) meets my 10+ years in the industrial manufacturing field.  And it took me 7 months to land this job.  Almost every job in a large urban area is through a staffing agency.  They'll ""hire"" you but typically don't ever offer any work.  I ended up with 4 who never gave me anything, including one prospect for a contract position that interviewed me.  It seemed to go very well, but then the company offering the contract and the agent both went dark.  I swear, the job search ""market"" has become an enormous extortion racket in the U.S.  Just like most everything else.",2025-09-18T19:27:26Z,3

The few that I have heard back from, had multiple rounds of interviews for barely over minimum wage pay. But more than that I feel like I had to submit documentation like I was applying for a mortgage, the only thing they didn’t ask for was blood, and this was requested before interviewing, not like at the end when they decide to move forward with you. I honestly thought something was wrong with me, even though I have the qualifications and experience that they are asking for.
