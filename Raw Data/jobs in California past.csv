I did articleship from mediocre firm and competed my CA in multiple attempts as I did self study for CA final subjects. After my CA I get to know about big 4 as I am person who is not very social, book worm kind. I did job after 2 years of passing CA as I planned by baby immediately after passing CA.. So I think you can imagine how tough it would be to get shortlisted for interview in good companies, forget about big 4. As I was not getting shortlisted anywhere, I started with walkin interviews of big 4 and I got selected in one of them. I never thought I could be in big 4. So what is important is just keep trying with your 100 % efforts in everything you do. Automatically things will start changing gradually.. But yeah big 4 jobs are Pressurizing But not for me because ""mehant karni hai kahi bhi kar lengay."".",2020-06-09T18:42:35Z,236

If you take away the opportunity for every qualified person, be they men or women, then you get the outcome that bests fits what your actions. That outcome is more than likely the opposite of what these so-called lawmakers are looking for. True equality includes opportunity for people to make their own decisions. Some of those decisions need to be the wrong ones and can lead to better chances to make the right ones for better outcomes. Not every women who goes into medical school wants to be an OB-GYN and not every man wants to be a mechanic.

I actually think that many ""feminists"" simply do not have children yet or intend not to have them. Because almost every woman I know who has had children either doas not go back to full time work at all, or at the very least they do not go back to work as quickly as they had imagined they would have after having a child.  And. I have also noticed that women tend to be really upset when their children accomplish some milestone and working again for means that they had to miss seeing it!",2018-09-07T07:00:00Z,1

Office jobs might be a little more discreet only by virtue of timid women being preyed on by boorish males. These types are put off so much by the pressure they often give in against their will and go along just to fit in and keep the job.In fact try to make the most out of it.In this setting women would much rather be left alone.Gossip is a given.Good luck with scapegoating and co worker vitriol.",2018-10-27T15:56:14Z,0

I have done a lot of research about the minimum wage, and my personal conclusion is:   _ While it would help employees as a whole, it would hurt small businesses because they can't afford to pay the higher wage. Gradually, small businesses will be out of business because they can't compete with large corporations. I have not yet found anyone who tackle this issue directly. And I think it's a reason why minimum wage is being opposed by so many people, especially small business owners.  What do you think about a $15 Minimum Wage solution where it only target large corporations (over $10 millions in annual revenue, for example), while letting small business set their own wages? This would give small businesses a chance to compete with large corporation, and I would argue that it gives people more incentive to open new businesses, thus stimulating the economy.   Thanks, Van Vo.",2019-04-03T19:07:39Z,2

In CA, homelessness is a good example.  It isn't quite the mess conservative sites make it out to be, and it certainly is not stoked by 'liberal' policies or anything like that... but it's still a major problem.  Certainly a bigger problem than we'd see in states where the weather conspires to force shelter.   But that doesn't mean other states have less of a problem... states like Mississippi don't actually count homeless as homeless.  'Poverty and Homelessness' in one state is not equivalent to 'Poverty and Homelessness' in another, simply by virtue of how state governments count those people.  In California's case the homeless are pushed into the limelight by the insane housing market.  Rents and home prices have gone through the roof due to demand and the continuous, huge, cash influx into the state from the (international) tech industry.  Weather is mild year-round, so there is little cyclical pressure on the homeless to have to find actual shelter beyond a tent.  They wind up, very visible, in tent communities under highway overpasses, along the borders of industrial areas, and other places.  The entire west coast of the U.S. is like this.  The tech industry isn't just Silicon Valley.... tech is attracted to the West Coast of the U.S. (of which CA is a big piece) by the presence of a highly-educated, technically-savvy workforce that numbers in the millions.  It overflows S.V., it overflows San Francisco, it overflows all the nearby cities including the ones that used to be crime-ridden like Oakland and Richmond (which have become much less so over the last decade, though its still pretty bad in certain areas).   The same thing is happening in the greater L.A. area.  In Seattle, in Vancouver (Canada), etc.  Gentrification runs rampant because of this overflow situation and the need for all those workers to find housing, spreading out from mass-transit hubs.  You can get from Berkeley to SF (all the way across the bay) in 20 minutes on BART, for example.  Gentrification (primarily realized by the insane rental and housing markets) is the primary driver behind people leaving the state.  In other-words, CA is 'full' (at least when it comes to housing anywhere along the coasts).  It's not taxes, liberal politics, or anything else.  Its simple housing pressure.  -Matt",2019-04-10T05:31:10Z,0

But,since there really is a good old boys club nowadays if I kept getting passed over for advancement,NOW, you would have to see me going to fed court,and lawyers and sue the bleedin company for breaking the law.NO,I WOULD NOT BE NICE about it NOW.ALL WE WOMEN DID THAT--we never sued.but now,I would advise young women to go out,get real evidence of your case an sue the f--- company for discrimination.  WHY?CAUSE THE BIG BOYS ONLY UNDERSTAND ONE THING;IF YOU ARE A WOMAN TRYING TO HAVE A CAREER,YOU BETTER BE TOUGH AS NAILS,UNRELENTING, AND NEVER LET THEM S--- ON YOU THE WAY WE 70'S WOMEN LET THEM DO.  WE WERE TOO NICE---so you guys walked all over us.the tough b**ches had the success and they made those guys sorry,they ever got passed over.  WE LEARNED TOO LATE,all those guys respect is if we figuratively clobber them,match them blow for blow,and are just as agressive and nasty as those men are.--not give in an inch, and not be passively nice.AND SUE THE DAMNED COMPANY IF YOU HAVE TO.  you can avoid the stupid California law--its bad.  YOU KNOW WHO the successful women were? they were the real bad b**ches who screamed and yelled, made sure they forced guys to include them.THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL. we passive nice women never succeeded. NO WAY.IN ANY FIELD OR CAREER.--  I learned the hard way--i was a ""nice person.""it was a huge mistake in any career field.i let companies refuse to place and they said out loud""we do not place women only men.""and they got away with it.  So i advice young women""be an iron fist in a velvet glove.""do not back down the way we did.if you have to get mean and nasty, do it,cause they were the only women who succeeded--unless they slept with everyone.  you don't need this California bill.but you better get ready to get sued.if you discriminate against young career women now.--cause I advise young women now, BE A TOUGH NASTY BITCH and they won't stop you then.BE POLITE--but be tough as nails under the ""nice.""AND NEVER EVER let them pass you over, or push you around. it's not worth it.""==  AN OLD FEMINISTS' ADVICE TO YOUNG WOMEN--WHICH I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MYSELF.I WAS ""TOO NICE""and I really regret it.""  --clarachan1355  Reply",2018-09-07T16:37:36Z,0

My specialty is drivers license laws vs traveling in person property on a public road system. Most people are not drivers and do not need a drivers license. But you need to know the law in and out to protect yourself when pulled over. For instance, when asked for a drivers license most will say I don't have one or don't need one. You need to stop the officer from going down the path of drivers license laws. You need to say that I am not a driver but in fact a traveler. Make sure you have a copy of the words  driver, transportation and vehicle legal deffinitions. All legal deffinitions talk about you need to be using the public roads for profits either for yourself or by a company transporting goods or services. Most do not do that so all the drivers license laws would not apply to the person.",2018-12-03T20:51:42Z,1

VBELTANDSON.COM.,2019-02-13T15:42:19Z,@siRiderkdw9,I’m lucky that a contractors license is NOT required in my state for anyone other than roofers and one or two other types of contractors. I’d have to look it back up to remember the other one or two types. I have a lot of unnecessary paperwork that I’m not required to have. But I figured better to be safe than sorry. I’ve thought about out of state work though. So a contractors license may be in my near future.,2019-02-13T22:40:48Z,0
