Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

Again, that's if someone books you, or ""ring"" you so to speak. They pay weekly on PayPal. It definitely comes in handy. If you have insomnia, get up and teach.

Pretty much every study ever done shows people are more productive when working from home, but they can’t control you when you’re at home, and they _hate_ it. Theoretically, as long as you’re performing well, getting your work done and hitting goals, they should be happy. But employees who work from home can almost always do that and still do stuff like… run errands, take a shower, hell, get laid. Companies don’t like that. They want to own you. If you have second job, their control over your income source and health insurance goes away. They don’t like that. They’ll fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening.

I've read a lot of comments about senior command staff being the biggest problem. I totally agree. The world thinks so much of police, but they have no idea what it is really like. They have no idea what people will do to each other to get promoted,  to get that special detail, to get that detective position. People would always say to me, ""you guys don't get paid enough..."" You are correct. But not for the reasons you think. I carried a gun, wore body armor and was trained to deal with all sorts of threats from domestic encounters, three hundred pound drunks, meth heads and active shooters. But there is no armor, no training that can protect you from a weaponized administration. The world would be shocked at the things I have seen.  But now I have a nice job and get a check every month from my department's retirement that reminds me that I don't have those problems any more.   All the best, young lady.

The real reason many have long avoided low-wage jobs isn’t laziness—it’s that the pay often doesn’t cover basic living expenses....................... The deeper problem lies at the top: executives are paid at levels completely disconnected from the rest of the workforce. Whether their company succeeds or fails, they’re financially secure—able to move on to the next position or live comfortably off their wealth. They have no real incentive to worry about hiring, layoffs, or employee well-being.  If executive salaries were even remotely proportional—say, 3 to 5 times higher than the average worker’s instead of 150 times—this problem might start to fix itself.  Meanwhile, prices keep rising, and with jobs harder to find (and bills still due), wages are effectively shrinking.

In many industries, AI systems are now handling tasks that used to be done by junior employees or interns. This creates a paradox: companies require experience for mid- and senior-level roles, but the entry-level jobs where that experience is usually gained are no longer available. As a result, new graduates and career-switchers are left with no real pathway to break into the field.  This issue is especially pronounced in tech and creative sectors, where automation and generative AI can already perform a wide range of tasks that were once assigned to beginners. If people can’t get that first job, they can’t build a portfolio, learn on the job, or advance in their profession. It becomes a closed loop — one that excludes the next generation of talent before they even have a chance to start.

Rather than protecting American businesses, the act caused a sharp drop in international trade and deepened the economic hardships of the Great Depression.  Key reasons the Smoot-Hawley Tariff failed Sparked global trade wars In response to the U.S. raising tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods, foreign nations retaliated with their own tariffs on American products. Canada, the biggest U.S. trading partner at the time, was one of the first to respond with countermeasures. This cycle of ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" protectionism worsened the global economic crisis.  Caused international trade to plummet Between 1929 and 1934, global trade volumes shrank by approximately 65%. U.S. imports and exports to Europe fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932. The decline in exports was especially damaging to American farmers, who had already been struggling with overproduction and low prices.  Failed to help the U.S. economy The act's goal was to protect American industries and farmers, but the result was higher prices for American consumers at a time when purchasing power was already weak. The drop in exports contributed to bank failures and worsening unemployment, pushing the country deeper into the Depression.  Ignored warnings from economists More than 1,000 U.S. economists signed a petition urging President Herbert Hoover to veto the bill. However, Hoover signed the bill into law in June 1930, overriding the concerns of the experts.  Contributed to global political instability Beyond the immediate economic fallout, the Smoot-Hawley Act is seen by some historians as contributing to the rise of political extremism in other countries by destabilizing their economies.  Historical context and legacy The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act did not cause the Great Depression, which was already underway, but it is widely considered a major policy misstep that exacerbated the crisis. The act is a classic cautionary tale in modern economics, highlighting the dangers of protectionist trade policies and the interconnectedness of the global economy.",2025-09-18T01:16:00Z,101

Even though the population was large, many people in that cohort ended up in unstable or part-time jobs, which caused the birth rate to drop sharply and accelerated population decline.  Now the situation has gone too far in the opposite direction: because of the shrinking population, almost every workplace is suffering from labor shortages. People in their 20s and 30s are especially in high demand, and even those with no experience are trained closely and carefully.  Thirty years ago, companies were in a position to choose workers and often acted arrogantly. Today, it’s the other way around—young workers will simply say, “If that’s the kind of company this is, goodbye,” and quit.

2JvZYSHsyyo,Why Jobs Are Disappearing In The U.S.,Relatively few people are finding new jobs in the United States. The slowdown in hiring comes as businesses navigate rapidly ...,2025-09-17T18:05:31Z,@rendermanpro,"The rapid and widespread implementation of AI and automation in recent years has created a significant disruption in the global labor market. While these technologies were introduced under the promise of improving efficiency and reducing costs, the social and economic consequences have been largely underestimated — or ignored altogether.  By replacing human labor at scale — in everything from customer service to programming, logistics, and even creative work — we've created a situation where millions of people are being pushed out of the workforce faster than new opportunities are being created. The result is not just higher unemployment, but also a shrinking consumer base. People without stable incomes cannot meaningfully participate in the economy, which undermines the very demand that companies rely on to sustain their operations.  Automation has certainly increased productivity in many sectors, but that increase has not translated into broad-based prosperity. Instead, it has concentrated profits in fewer hands while leaving large portions of the population economically insecure. This isn't just a technological issue — it's a systemic one, where economic structures are not adapting fast enough to absorb the social impact of automation.  Without a balanced approach — one that includes thoughtful regulation, reskilling programs, and policies that ensure people can still afford to live and participate in society — we risk creating a cycle where efficiency gains actually weaken the economy rather than strengthen it.  AI and automation are powerful tools, but without a long-term vision and human-centered planning, they can do more harm than good.",2025-09-17T20:29:54Z,6

I did it for about 7 months this year to bridge a gap, and it was pretty chill. At first I did app support, which was annoying if there was yet another big bug customers caled about, then I switched teams to customer service for the local expo and congress center and the only time that it was actually busy was in the days during and leading up to larger expos. The rest of the time, I wouldn't even get calls for an hour or more and could just fart around on my phone while answering the occasional email. It was a great lazy girl job.

I’ve had a few interviews. But no job offer. I even reached out to alumni and employees in the industry on LinkedIn. But they rarely reply back and when they do, they just repeat the same advice and say how they’ll reach out if their company will hire. These past 4 months have been the worst months of my life. Legit can’t fall asleep at night because of worry of being unemployed and not being able to pay bills on time or support myself. I’ve had multiple emotional outbursts and panic attacks in my room where I broke my ps5 controller in half randomly and even tore my shirt off my body once. All because of not getting a chance from the hundreds of jobs I applied and interviewed at. College was a joke and I regret wasting four years of my life there smh. For now I’m just going to apply to fast food and retail jobs until I figure my life out.

I applied to the customer success advocate role for Square (owned by block) right after you talked about the two cashapp manager positions which I did not apply to since there not something I'm interested in, anyway I'm getting sidetracked. I applied right after hearing you speak about the block roles and 30 minutes I swear it was 30 minutes later the recruiter was texting me to schedule a quick 15 minute phone call with her today (which I did do) because they are closing the role by next weekend, I am now moving onto the next interview with two team leads in the department next week and if chosen will start August 12th for $19 an hour, fully remote HOWEVER the job listed did state they wanted people within 50 miles of 3 locations luckily I am near one of the locations. Ya'll please pray for me I need this right now. I am next, we are next, you are next. We got this! <3",2025-07-16T06:11:30Z,393

I'm taking a leap of faith with you. So many influencers give bogus jobs that are supposedly always hiring or that are really good jobs and it ends up being nothing but spam. I'm not even sure what made me click on the video in the first place but something told me to do it while I was cleaning and after listening I have decided to come back and to take notes. If I actually get a job because you gave me the information I don't even know what I can do in return for you because I am in desperate need of one and it would be a blessing to actually get a decent job especially if it's remote in which I don't have to worry about trying to find a ride nor walking for hours just to get to and from work.",2025-08-03T19:48:32Z,1

Just yesterday in Ocala Fl I had a man blow a stop sign and crash into my flatbed trailer just about where this minivan hit this moron's trailer. He hit me at 45mph or more, he destroyed my trailer and the only reason he is alive is because my trailer had side boxes full of gear and an APU that prevented him from going under my trailer. He and his wife were at a wedding yesterday and they are lucky to walk away from this. I have over 30 years as an OO, no ticket, no claims, no violations and accidents happen.....but what this illegal guy did was a crime, and these guys need to be taken off the road immediately.",2025-08-18T16:53:40Z,27

I mainly only hear yt ppl complain about this, which is crazy cus it’s not minorities that are taking these major 6 figure jobs by storm. Lmfao yall pushing this narrative yet we’re still massively underrepresented in these high end fields. Look up ANY high end profession from engineers, to lawyers, to physicians, to even police officers, to firefighters, to CEOs, etc. people of color are still by FAR the minority in positions like this. Idk where this illusion came up in yall minds we taking all the good jobs from you when we not. It’s many of us still struggling.  Black people still have lowest college grad rates yet yall say all you gotta do is be black to get into a Uni🤦🏾‍♂️  Yall legit create problems that aren’t even there, I WISH there were as many minorities as yall claim there was in position and our communities would likely be further.  Another thing is yall throw around DEI hire when we work our butts off to become something and be in position the right way, the American way.

At the time, the department was ranked in the top 5 of all departments in the country by the insurance industry, and departments from across the world sent crews to learn training and operations methods from the department. I applied and scored in the top 10%, the city charter allowed police and fire to hire only from the top 25%.   The city council mandated that, without regard of where they scored, of those hired, 1/3 would be black, 1/3 would be female. 1/6 other 'protected class' and the rest could be off the top of the list.   When they ran out of their Affirmative Action (now DEI) hires, they issued a new test. I tested 4 more times, always scoring in the top 10%, never hired.   My friend, since transferred to the training division, told me to not waste my time and energy testing a 6th time, as a white male, I would not be hired. 20 years later, the department ranked in the bottom 1/3 by the insurance industry, no other department looks to them as an example.   How are the citizens of the city better served by higher insurance rates, slower response times, poorly trained firefighters, sloppy fire field management and firefighters promoted to senior positions based on color, gender, and sexual preference rather than performance and qualifications?

Let me tell you why it was.  First off, for the last two weeks, just about ALL of the local media outlets have been reporting ""Gaylord is looking to hire on-the-spot interviews with hundreds of positions to fill....""  THAT....did not happen. I was there Friday morning at 6:30am and there was just about 12-15 people already there. By 9:50am, there must of been at least close to 2k people there waiting in line.  My interview basically was I was the first applicant for the department I was applying for and that made me feel good.  I was asked ""Tell me about yourself"" and when doing so, the interviewer interrupted me and basically said ""ok good"" with about three more simply yes or no questions.  I was then ushered to a hiring manager who basically was asked the same three yes or no questions and right after that, he said ""We'll be in touch..."" and the interview ended.   The entire interview process lasted not even close to ten minutes. I wasn't even given the chance to ask the questions I has written down to find out more information.   So if you're hiring a 1k+ people for positions and I was their first applicant for a department, I should of been hired ""on-the-spot"" like they're advertising to be doing. I felt really good and proud that I was going to be their first hire in one of their departments and it didn't happen.   Not complaining that I got the interview, it's the way it was handled and the way it went that I was absolutely NOT impressed with. My impression was there was just no professionalism in the interview process...  And the notion that Gaylord was telling local media outlets that they were going to be hiring on the spot, absolute joke.",2025-03-08T19:59:25Z,15

It was created because Mr spreckels and men like the Kimball Brothers wanted this city to be a thriving port they were alive today they'd be in awe of the stupidity that is the Port of San Diego and that is these old major cities like National City Chula Vista and San Diego thrilled to have a hotel be its iconic Force instead of the actual port a natural seaport that can bring in commerce that can bring in world trade and that can provide good middle class stable jobs for people to afford homes,2025-03-10T18:48:03Z,0
