This was a really interesting video. I don't think any other Vox anchor went into in that much detail about their hiring process, and it gives that much more respect for what you do.  I'm sure I'm not alone, but for me Vox Borders became synonymous with Johnny Harris. Much like BBC's flagship documentaries came to be associated with David Attenborough. He's just that prolific of a storyteller.  I'm not mincing my words when I say this: Johnny is literally my idol and I aspire to be as good as him, if not better.

It was all hard work, many times I worked alongside immigrants and I totally respect their work ethic and ambition! Down the road from me now in Whatcom county is a beautiful big (wealthy) berry farm that relies on immigrant labor for pruning and other work (but harvest is done mechanically). They have had a big Trump flag flying out front for the last 6 months or so. I wonder what their immigrant laborers think about that, or if they will even be available to work anymore.

The farmers we worked for didn't pay much; some were nice to us, but most treated us like garbage. Child labor laws were enacted when I was in the fifth grade, but the farmers didn't comply because nobody came out to inspect. From 4 to 16 years old, summer, before and after school, hard labor was what we knew. Our parents were allowed to force us to work. The humiliation my siblings and I had to go through was nearly unbearable when attending schools in these wealthy farming communities where kids came to school dressed well and smelling good. It was customary to hear nasty smelly Mexicans. The best part about school was that some of the teachers and teachers' aids did show compassion, allowing us to sleep in class or even fix our hair. Working like this had its positives because it pushed us to become something more. My brothers all went to college, and I went to beauty school. It's so nice to work in a temperature-controlled environment. I hope some changes are made. I hope they allow migrants to work legally and pay them higher wages. Migrants will make the income they deserve, and perhaps college and high school kids will be encouraged to do these jobs in the summer.

If not, then shame on Americans for being lazy or think that job is beneath them.

These are great jobs for youth except they consider themselves 'above that sort of work'...thinking they are above that sort of labor....snotty brats...People over 50 were working in ag as kids.

This was one of three cities we were considering for possible retirement. We stayed in a nice motel near the Seatac airport and rode the no hassle inexpensive light rail back and forth each day. We chose to do it that way so that we could get a feel for the area by traveling though the various communities on our way in and out. Our first day started at the Seattle Public Market overlooking Puget Sound. Glorious scenery! Loved the market ambience, abundant food options (BAKERIES, CHOWDER and COFFEE!!), fish tossing guys, original 100+yr old market with all the flowers etc. For us....""to die for"". Used all the wonderful public transportation options! Took the West Seattle ferry and enjoyed walking around the shops etc. Went to Alki Beach park. Took the ferry to Bainbridge Island and wallowed in the many opportunities for us to see and eat. The spectacular views of downtown Seattle and Puget Sound from a different vantage point as we returned in the early evening. Rode the one mile mono-rail to the Space Needle, sculpture park and surrounding area. Strolled through the offerings of Fremont, spent a lot of time absorbing the iconic Seattle Central Library designed by Rem Koolhass, Pioneer Square and park (we noticed one small tent and a few people standing around, but took no note of it....yes, who would have realized what that would portend for Seattle 7yrs. later) and took the Amtrak Cascade train from the beautifully restored King Street rail station Puget Sound north along the coast to Bellingham/Fairhaven and the U of Western Washington. We LOVED Seattle, but at that time decided it way over what we would be able to afford AND it DID rain all the time. We would have looked forward to revisiting, but not anymore.......so sad.",2020-07-23T20:15:30Z,4
