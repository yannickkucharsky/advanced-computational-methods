He made it past tense not because he was considering leaving, but because he already understood that his system for success was going to be adopted by teams with greater purchasing power, removing the advantage he'd had as an early adopter.  Jonah Hill's character is perfectly portrayed as still immature (not in a negative way) about decision making. Billy's decision to stay/leave was personal, not professional or financial, and those personal circumstances were the same after meeting with the Red Sox as they were before. Billy wasn't going anywhere because of that, yet Hill's character still tries to influence Billy by hitting home a point that Billy already fully understood: baseball had been changed, and Billy was worth top dollar.",2025-05-19T18:03:35Z,141

We shouldn't hire him."" I don't blame them, but I don't see it fair game being the outcome was quite the ordeal. Gen Z are literal slaves to the economy. We want to work, but how can we when seeing barely any openings are given?

I'm like, ""Because back in your day, you were given hope in society by people who spoke highly about it and actually got through with their promises, and an easier job market than ours."" The system has changed. It's rare to hear Boomers to have some empathy towards us, but the majority see us as just the worst.

Let’s be honest skills can be taught and jobs know this, but they need leverage to not pay. Hence, since everyone has a degree now, wages did not increase, because that wasn’t the plan. The plan was to use the degree to exploit more work for less pay(ie you’re not qualified). There were never enough jobs for ppl with degrees. If everyone is a doctor why do I need to pay 100k when I can get the same job done for 30-40k. Without exploitation you can’t have rich or poor. How I know? I’m a capitalist.

Clea very clearly doesn’t acknowledge anything living in the canvas as truly being alive, but I think Renoir does. He doesn’t talk down to Lune or Sciel, he acknowledges their thoughts, feelings, even acknowledging that the points they make are “true.” He acknowledges their thoughts cruelty of his wife re-painting Verso and clearly feels guilt and remorse for it. I think Renoir acknowledged their existence as living things and regrets how bastardized the canvas has become because of Aline. He’s just so worried about his family that they’re a sacrifice he’s willing to make.",2025-10-10T15:53:54Z,0

Coming from à poor background, I did what I had to do: temping jobs at minimum salary.... for 4 1/2 years! Soul crushing! Being a  woman I was also told at my age I would not be given a permanent job as I would have kids soon and be a liability for the company! But I managed to build some kind of experience in finance in those temp jobs.  Then I moved in 1997 to London with my British boyfriend ( husband now!). Got a temp job, then an offer, at the bottom of the barrel, in an investment bank in the city. My small temp experience for few years did help. I took it and worked hard to climb.

I can't believe that any employer would find this behavior appealing.  They come across as unstable or what I call emotional incontinent.   Please stop doing this stuff!  Please embrace anonymity.   Learn to reign in your emotions because, contrary to popular belief,  being emotional is not beneficial.  Meekness, which is strength under control, and self-control are the attributes that strengthen your character.   If you are controlled by your emotions,  how will you be able to deal with the pressures of a high pressure job?  How will you be able to deal with difficult coworkers, difficult bosses, and difficult clients?  Please, young people,  stop exposing your vulnerabilities and start showing your professionalism.

They advertise these graduates and pretend they are successful because they went to Harvard. But that's a false assumption; it's all down to pre-selection.

Fast forward in 2025 he is blessed with an executive position in one of the city of Chicago’s government agencies and thriving very well and so grateful for where he is. He did not need a Harvard diploma to carve success for himself. He just needed self determination and dedication. No need to pile on student loans on top of it just to come out on the other side being told in your face you’re not a good fit for a job as a Harvardian. Ewww!

Several years later, I transferred to a great school. UC Berkeley, for those curious. I graduated back in May, and have sent out hundreds of applications. Without the support of family, I'd currently be homeless (and I realize how fortunate this makes me). 31 years old, a degree from a top school, and over ten years of prior working experience. Still can't land a decent job; McDonald's won't even take me. The American dream we were sold was a fat lie, and the elites have a vested interest in voters continuing to vote against progress for the working class. In the long run, this will destroy us.

No, but the foreign students are the cream of the applicants, with the Masters and PhD students particularly sought after, and all paying or having their nation's scholarships pay full fees. They don't just provide money to fund local students' education, they also provide the US with either skilled, gifted immigrants or people of influence in other nations who havenseen the better side of the US. 2. ""We want a list of those foreign students..."" No. The government has the visa details. Nah, they know who-all the students are. He is covering up the fact that they demanded, from Harvard, years of CCTV and general didgital and paper info of all sorts about students' activities - the sort of stuff which should require a warrant individual by individual. 3.

Mayo was seemingly more concerned with DEI and far left ideologies, from what's been reported from the players inside the locker room.  Don't expect miracles though in Coach Vrabel's first season. He's got to rebuild this disaster and instill his culture, but i have no doubt they'll at least be a .500 or better team next season. Let's GO!!😊",2025-01-12T23:59:04Z,5

I will say from my 5 years of experience in my career and what im learning in my program, I think that MBA is still worth it. I have been surprised on projects that I work on how so many people with specialized skillsets lack the ability to lead, communicate, and make sound business decisions. Their specialized skillsets are valueable when it comes to innovating, but there is value in knowing how to lead a team to innovate efficiently, knowing where to reduce costs or expedite timelines, and making informed decisions backed by knowledge provided in an MBA curriculum. However, i will agree that it does ultimately depend on what your interests are and where you want to develop your career. If you want a position in leadership, want to be an entrepreneur, did an undergrad in STEM but pivoted into business and lack fundamental business knowledge, an MBA is most likely worth it for you.",2025-02-08T18:21:11Z,1

Sturm kennt die NHL und weiß worauf es ankommt. Sturm hat die deutsche Eishockey Nationalmannschaft an einem Tiefpunkt übernommen, 2014 nicht mal für Olympia qualifiziert und 2018 zu Silber geführt bei Olympia. Er formte junge Spieler zu sehr guten Spieler und dank der Vorarbeit von ihm konnte die deutsche Eishockey Nationalmannschaft 2023 Silber bei der WM holen und schalteten sogar die USA in der Overtime aus. Ich finde es richtig Klasse, dass die Bruins Sturm eingestellt haben und durch ihn können junge Spieler richtig aufgebaut werden. Sturm stellt sich schützend vor seine Spieler und nimmt dadurch den öffentlichen Druck von den Spielern. Sturm ist in Deutschland eine Legende und wird Bruins zumindest was aufbauen was den anderen Trainer helfen wird, man darf nur keine Wunder erwarten, oder doch?? Es war schließlich ein schönes Märchen und Wunder 2018 die Silbermedaille zu gewinnen, gefühlt war es für uns Gold, denn die Deutschen spielten gegen die Doping verseuchten Russen, obwohl die Eishockey Nationalmannschaft wohl sauber war. Trotzdem war für die deutschen Fans Silber wie Gold.",2025-06-08T07:59:22Z,0
