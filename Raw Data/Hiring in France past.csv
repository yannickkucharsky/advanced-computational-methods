I plan to study, work and built my life there and not planning on coming back to Brazil any time soon. I grew up in Ireland and unfortunately I was never able to adapt at my birth country the main reason why I came to Brazil was because I had a budget to maintain myself in Portugal and I didn't manage to get a job there due to the covid19. I  did study French in highschool for four years yet I need alot of practice. I plan to get a visa and all the right documents.. I am searching for jobs and everything.
