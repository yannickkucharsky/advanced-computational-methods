Land was inexpensive $4,500 for 5 acres. High and dry ,never flooded, just cleared the 5 acres next door. So the total yard is 10 acres total,  all fenced in with large oaks, and a 2800 square foot home with pool. Just worked hard for it, just like we all do. Now the mobile Homes park's have made insane offers of this 10 acres.  But we're do you move to, but we will sell out one day. Like your videos, just keeping it simple.

If you get a job, the pay, even in construction, is very low. We have no income tax, but we have no income. Construction wages have gone down because immigrants have flooded the field. BTW, immigrant construction quality is atrocious. I used to get $30 to paint--professional quality painting--now it's down to $11-$12 an hour to start. You will not pay rent on $12 an hour. You will need to find a room to rent, but that will cost you $600 a  month. Lots of people in Florida room up, five or six to a house, to be able to afford rent on $12 an hour.   Business is happy with immigrants, because they absolutely lower all wages while keeping the cost of living high.

I lived in NY for 26 yrs. Everybody knows how over crowded it is and the crowd is not exactly pleasant. The winters have been BRUTAL, if you drive you will be miserable. I got married and moved into 2 bedroom apartment paying $1425 per month. The second room was the size of a walk in closet. My wife and I made a combined $75k per yr. before taxes. After taxes we were making $52000. We had car payment, ins, utility bills, food, misc. etc. and were managing to save almost $1k per month. I have an ear condition that got progressively worse and the cold weather made it more acute. Combining my health condition and the STRESS of living in NY, I honestly felt that I was going crazy. My quality of life was ZERO. I decided to move to central Florida and my wife and I got jobs with the dept. of Education. It is not the best but we make a combined $3900 per month after taxes. We are currently renting a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom house with beautiful scenery and peaceful environment for $1250, We still pay car, ins, utilities, food, misc, etc. We manage to save the same about 1k per month. We are already planning on purchasing a home. Would I have been able to consider that in NY? NO.  In order for a married couple to purchase a home, they have to make a combined 150k and the house will not compare with what you can get in florida for just 200k. With that said, the quality of life cannot compare to NY. I feel alive here. In NY? dying slowly. I'm not saying that there are pros and cons and that everything has a catch but that is my honest experience so far.",2018-07-05T00:15:16Z,45

I have an MBA in Technology Management and I work from home for a Downtown Chicago software company (I originally got hired in their Cleve office and then moved to work remote) so I am doing good. I always hear about the low paying jobs here and the bad traffic (which I dont have to drive in either). I have sales and higher education experience as well. Thankfully, its just me, no kids, no hubby so I dont have the stress of having to take care of a family. The rent and car insurance is the only things that are higher. Everything else is lower compared to Cleveland so for me, it’s a wash. Hopefully if I ever have to find a job here, I’ll look for companies in other states that have offices or remote positions in Florida or I’ll just make sure I’m debt free so if I have to take a pay cut it wont matter. I looove the Florida weather (Palm Harbor/WestCoast) and it is truly paradise here and beautiful. The people are friendly as well.
