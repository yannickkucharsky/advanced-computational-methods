Pretty much every study ever done shows people are more productive when working from home, but they can’t control you when you’re at home, and they _hate_ it. Theoretically, as long as you’re performing well, getting your work done and hitting goals, they should be happy. But employees who work from home can almost always do that and still do stuff like… run errands, take a shower, hell, get laid. Companies don’t like that. They want to own you. If you have second job, their control over your income source and health insurance goes away. They don’t like that. They’ll fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening.

So he started looking for other jobs and now he is actually working his full-time job making 80k a year that he picked up another full-time job that he does simultaneously making 90k a year and he works with me doing larger plumbing installs. Making one to 3K a week. That's a lot of money but the real trick is he pays for his cars in cash and he lives in a tiny little house on 17 acres that only costs him $700 a month. So no car payment. Makes over 200 Grand a year and doesn't even spend $10,000 a year on bills And no kids. Me and him are going to split hydro excavation truck. They are $200,000 and can dig a 1 ftx1-ft hole straight down 15 ft through all kinds of underground gas pipes and fiber optic wires. 200 Grand but you get $400 an hour for the truck and an operator.

They have no idea what people will do to each other to get promoted,  to get that special detail, to get that detective position. People would always say to me, ""you guys don't get paid enough..."" You are correct. But not for the reasons you think. I carried a gun, wore body armor and was trained to deal with all sorts of threats from domestic encounters, three hundred pound drunks, meth heads and active shooters. But there is no armor, no training that can protect you from a weaponized administration. The world would be shocked at the things I have seen.

When you work for an agency that shows lack of trust, respect and simple kindness towards its Officers, there's a problem.  The hatred between Officers and Management was at an all-time high.  Morale was at an all-time low.  This lasted my entire 28 year career.  I miss my beat partners, but not the department!!",2025-09-09T23:27:08Z,227

A mother leaving work passed by the scene to find out it was her husband and daughter that died in a wreck just a few miles from their home. I got out and went to driving a semi truck. I just couldn't take anymore of that. You want to help or say something to console them but what do you say or do in that kind of situation. It wasn't for me.

The only way that is even a livable wage is living in a poor/very rural area. Cost of living has surged and people are out of touch with how much it cost to live.   Rent where i live is an average of 1.6k-2k monthly where I live and a car payment is an average of 650 dollars which is necessary in the US as public transportation lacks anywhere outside a major city walls. That means you spend 66.25 percent on your income just on those bills alone. Add in taxes, emergencies, and all other bills you can’t make a living.",2025-08-21T12:58:06Z,25

Basically even if you’re making less than 25k, so well below the poverty rate, you’re still considered employed. But it’s no stretch to say that someone who’s only able to work once every 2 weeks is functionally unemployed, so the _functional_ unemployment rate is actually 25%, which is worse than the Great Depression. This really brings to light why the politicians think the economy has been doing so well when the reality on the ground is rather bleak, they’ve been getting fed the wrong numbers and never see the reality from Mount Olympus.",2025-07-07T14:38:33Z,45

If he complained about the low pay his dad allowed him, he was reminded that they don't have to pay him, and that if he wanted to keep the job, he wouldn't mention his qualifications since they couldn't afford him otherwise.  He ended up quitting and did a bunch of freelance work for about 6 years while in college/after graduation.  Last I heard, he was working in T.V. network I.T. work, but that was about 10 years ago.

ATS systems have nothing to do with the impact ChatGPT and generative AI has on the labour market and it's not helpful to confuse the two.

I went back to get my Masters after 3 years experience in pathology (hospital laboratory). My degree was in Biomedical Science and I graduated in 2018, prior to my Master degree I was teaching for a couple of years (never again), yes it’s that bad!  Anyway, I knew I would need my Masters at one point or another so I went back to get it and specialised in Clinical Biochemistry.  In the 3 month gap between when I graduated and my final interview (March), I applied for around 30 jobs (including areas I had no experience in such as micro and haematology) and got the following interviews;  1. Interview as an Associate Practitioner (AP) in about 4 jobs (was my previous job before leaving). 2. An interview as a Medical Laboratory Assistant in two of them (including one in micro which required no experience but someone beat me). 3. Two interviews as a trainee Biomedical Scientist (one in virology and one in clinical chemistry).  Note, having the Biomedical Science degree itself is not enough to be a Biomedical Scientist. You also need to do a portfolio which grants you membership to the Health and Care Professions Council.  Anyway, back on topic. Even after attending said interviews (averaging 1 every 10 days) I got accepted for the best job I could have (the trainee post in chemistry) which was ironically the best paid job I’d applied for but it required me to move from home as it’s the best experience I could ask for.  I can tell you the job market out there is KILLER!

But they didn't, as soon as they lost 'graduate' status, they moved on. And the simple reason for that was that they didn't move salaries up enough while we were graduates, so salaries stagnated in highly skilled jobs, and we could see roles for up to double our salaries going on the outside. So I imagine a lot of grad roles have disappeared because companies didn't think they were getting a benefit out of it (staff retention), when in that all they had to do was be a little more proactive on internal progression/salary rises.",2025-07-14T14:31:02Z,2

An old time SCMer here.  I was one of the people who objected to the term DEVOps when it started to appear.  It never was just about development and operations.  For those of us that were far ahead of just build and deployment automation (I was doing CI/CD last century),  we looked at this and saw it for what it was - another brandwagon.  The focus on project centric DevOps was a great idea for increasing skills scarcity,  but was and still is detrimental.  I have been laughing as the more experienced devops practitioners discovered the same challenges we had already solved.  This latest move is definitely the best way to go now that the tooling has matured.  DevOp skills are skills,  not roles,  now the challenge is more around security which is the next area which needs much much more focus.  the days of faster time to market for more features is running into the reality - if it ain't secure it ain't complete.",2025-06-30T02:03:54Z,10

Like myself, I build the CI/CD and BAU pipelines for my customer’s applications. And I am not alone there’s a freelancer like me in every team, to do that. It costs a lot!!!

However, at that time, the roles were not yet clear.  Now the roles are becoming more and more clear, people should focus on more specialist tasks rather than doing everything - DevOps.

Before DevOps was a thing in the 2008-2010 era, Software Engineers had to test, compile the code themselves and then throw it over the fence to IT Operations for sysadmin admins to deploy and monitor. That slowed everything down hence why a new practice was created along with a specialty role DevOps Engineer to bridge the gap to make the software deployment more efficient. That was the really the only reason why DevOps exist. System Admin roles will still remain for quite some time but has evolved a lot to cloud in recent years.

But do you know something?, the IT operation professional are the more versatile and adaptable professionals handling technologies, cloud or on-premise technologies, so they always find the right path where to be when everything change.

Every effective team in any field has roles and the everyone gets the role that he fits best and actually likes to do. Otherwise you just burn out while task switching between new feature development (add ""full stack"" so now you're double fucked),  bug fixing,  on-call duty, agile meetings where you might need to solve management issues or ""syncing"" with other teams, etc. The IT industry was always hyping up things and thus oscillating between extremes, the truth is always somewhere between the extremes, we don't want people who are experts in only one field and don't care about anything else but we also don't want people who are not experts at anything b/c lack of time and motivation.",2025-07-30T11:45:31Z,0

If you have a big company that has different departments with big dev teams that you want them to just focus on development then you split the responsibilities.

I work at a university, prior to the tuition fees there was a cap on the number of applicants allowed on each course which was quite restrictive because funding was heavily reliant on limited public money. Tuition fees was a dream come true for the universities, it changed the whole industry overnight. The main goal went from trying to find and attract the best students, to ramming through as many students as possible to collect the 10 grand a year per student fees. Now suddenly anyone can get into at least 1 university, if not their first choice, there will be another one to collect their money. This has led to the rapid growth in the enrolment  of pointless degrees that yield no employment prospects, as well as an over saturation of the market with certain skills that previously would have been scarce. The whole education system is turning into just one big Ponzi scheme",2025-05-13T20:05:20Z,765

When looking at jobs abroad such as Canada or the USA their job requirements still ‘ask/expect’ a degree and/diploma but definitely a degree.   In the UK they ask for experience, they’re crafty. British employers do not credit degrees anymore, and want easy labour whereby people come with so many advanced amount of experience. How are you ment to get that when young. Worse thing is, uk employers dont even batter an eye lid at soft or transferable skills, they stick you to the same role and so its hard to move up or around.   Its simply the UK and their forever mounting job requirements that ppl cannot reach as no ones willing to give people a chance or look at their degree introspectivly.

Not so.   I went to one of the better universities for engineering in this country, and graduated with a first in my masters. I remember being told about the degree and it's employability, saying that engineering grads couldn't move for job offers.   When it came around to my final year, me and my friends began looking for grad roles at the beginning of my academic year (September, rolling off in July). I'd been to careers fairs, got my CV down to a page, got a perfect cover letter for each role, researched the company, etc. I applied to around 3 a day for the first three months, slimming down to maybe 1 a day until about May. I must have done about 200+ applications. Some of my mates did 400.   I got 2 offers, not excluding the other two which were scams. In the end, the grad schemes I got were pretty poor.   The whole thing feels busted. Even doing a ""hard"" subject feels like you've acquired the most basic qualification for applying to your field. After that, it's a soulless numbers game, and if you're not grafting hard from the beginning, you're left with very paltry options. Many people I know stayed on to do post-grad just because the job market was so dire.   And yet, the status quo is still ""if you want to be successful, go to university"". This current generation are sadly canaries in the coal mine for the commodification of university education.   Right now, the people who have it best are corporate apprentices: paid-for degree whilst working.   The whole thing is a mess.",2025-05-15T07:57:40Z,9

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0

Most companies will use them as direct hire programs since they literally get to try you out for 4 months and train you at a discounted rate. It’s a no brainer.

Mandelson and Blair are still at it behind the scenes, in spite of having no public mandate. Starmer the stooge is only there because the vile Blair is wholly unacceptable to the public. The corrupt Mandelson is only in the Lords because he would be unelectable to the commons, and he is too fond of power, and the good life to give up 'politics'. Their backers have invested a lot of money in those two, and they want their money's worth. Still, if we manage to get rid of Mandy,  Starmer will follow, because the Labour MPs will want to save there own cushy numbers, there will be no more appointments 'by the back door', as it were.....",2025-09-16T19:21:56Z,33

Starmer is a moral vacuum in a suit who 'looked the part' which is perhaps why he was chosen for the so called 'Labour Together' crew. A campaign built on deception and dubious funding.  I suspect Lammy was moved from  being Foreign Secretary to the post of Deputy Prime Minister ( which would usually be seen as a demotion) as McSweeny & Co had recognised Starmer's days were numbered. Mandelson should never had been given the job in the first place. Meanwhile a genocide is taking place in plain sight. Starmer and Lammy should be going to the Hague for providing diplomatic cover and military assistance. Cooper is now in the frame and as McSweeny runs things it seems reasonable for him to go to the Hague aswell.,2025-09-16T18:59:06Z,1
