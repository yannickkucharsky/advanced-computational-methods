Interesting I learned how to code and do stuff like pivot tables and work in Quickbooks. However also earned another degree with my CS one which was Philosophy. Many view it as stupid, but was very fun/easy to understand while many couldn't do the critical Philosophy classes. I thought as a kid, ""getting/doing Computer Science/IT will help A LOT for my future"", looks like that's not the case. The job market sucks and cannot find a job.

Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

For reference,  I teach industrial automation technologies how to set up, program, maintain and troubleshoot mechanical automation systems.  Setting up robotic assembly lines, building machines that build machines, etc.   I began teaching only a few years ago after many years in industry.   1. I was in the middle of the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Sometimes didn't know if I'd have a job next month because the plant was moving to overseas.  Also had to deal with many problems with parts and quality after those moves - and having to deal with supply chain when companies would decide to move their lines, but not build a product that directly replaced the one they quit making.  The corporate bottom line looked good, but the headaches from the people left was horrible, and worse, the devastation of the middle class was and is a reality.   2. The middle class is what made the US economy so strong, and it's a hollowed out shell.   Used to be, pretty much any job that wasn't flipping burgers was paying much more than minimum wage, and we didn't expect people to  go their entire lives on that pay.  It was for the kids in high school working part time or someone just out of school who was getting the entry level job that, in a month, or 3 or 6 was making much more than that.  Seriously, 20 years ago, minimum wage full time was less than 1% of the working population.   Actual middle class jobs were 75% of jobs (or more) and paid 10x that amount - AND you could afford to buy a car every couple of years, buy a house, and not have to go into future wage debt with credit cards.   Nowadays, people are trying to keep up appearances, but the US middle class is BROKE.    3. Companies have largely forgotten how to be loyal to employees. Used to be, you could get a job at age 20 or 25 and realistically could work there until retirement. And GROW, not just do the same job for 40 years.  The coming of the ""gig economy"" and the teaching by business schools of ""interchangeable economic units"" from a  Human Resources department had done a lot of the damage here.  Used to be, most middle and large sized companies had a significant training program in place where they would teach employees not only how to do their job, but also give them paths of advancement.   The disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street has choked that out.  For a long time,  you get hired for a job, and if you want a raise or a position advancement, you move somewhere else, instead of growing inside the company.    That seems to be changing a little... but not much. 4. These large tech corporations have done a marvelous job of publicly spreading risk while privately holding wealth - LLMs especially have been ripping off a lot of people from copyright, that, if it had been the other way, would have had the people getting sued - but the government has let the software companies get away with this ""for the greater good"" - even though it's pretty clear that LLMs are going to hurt a lot of people by not giving them a way into being productive. 5. Another dangerous thing about LLM - if it takes away the entry level ""easy"" tasks that are the training/honing tools for people to get good at, say, spotting cancers or other medical things - what happens in 10 or 20 years when all the current experts all die off? Who fills their shoes? If no one is allowed to get better because the job doesn't exist any more - then when there comes a time for the people to be there - where are they coming from?     Honestly, my field is the one area in manufacturing that still his hiring a lot of people - and we've kind of gone through that #5 part already - for many years the maintenance people didn't hire anyone because ""well, we've got Bob, and Bob knows everything"" - until Bob retires, or worse, drops dead from a heart attack...  now no one knows how to maintain the machines.  Smart companies have started waking up to that, and I keep praying the rest of industry does as well - but we've let too much money wreck the safeguards of government - and too many are focused on next quarter instead of next year or 5 years...   Meanwhile, I'm going to train as many people as I can, because when the robots do rise up, the people best able to defeat them are the ones who know how they work.",2025-09-06T14:59:40Z,173

The assumption that we can just retrain everybody runs into serious problems every time I've seen it tested.

It isn't easy to tell someone who loves, let's say, working with animals, and tell them ""Sorry, now you have to become an architect."" (2) Many people, after 10-20 years of work experience, become pretty good at doing the EXACT JOB THEY ALREADY HAVE but would be pretty useless if asked to do anything else, even jobs that, on paper, look like the same job. (3) For the most part, people already have the most mentally / intellectually demanding job they can perform. Do not assume you can take a reasonably smart supply chain analyst who hasn't been to school in 15+ years and tell them ""We'll train you to teach English in Japan, since AI can't do that yet.""

Keep going, and get out into nature when you are not applying for jobs. Take a bus to go somewhere to hike. Get away from people as much as you can and refresh yourself.   Then try and find local job postings for SMALL businesses. And I mean small. Big tech will replace lower end employees faster than small mom and pop places who care about people. Aim to have enough, not excess. Learn to be content, not grinding. You will find happiness moment to moment, not in large clumps.

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment. Because in these jobs failure is not hard, but ""only"" results in a less satisfying customer experience, instead of a total production or process failure.",2025-08-13T18:22:00Z,915

Companies then take advantage of these students to either make them work for free or ask for ""fees for training"" to allow them to ""work"" as an intern to get the work hour requirements.

So this was already a huge problem, and the inclusion of foreign contractors in countries with significantly lower costs of living changes it, but doesn’t _dramatically_ change it. It’s an acceleration, not an inflection point.   Which doesn’t mean that it’s not bad or not worth talking about. And the acceleration can make a thing that was a minor problem around the edges into a society-undermining problem. But most humans are very bad at recognizing creeping threats, very bad at planning for nebulous threats, and bad-to-very-bad at cognitive empathy. So I think the lack of conversation reflects lack of recognizing that this is a systemic problem. Thanks for bringing it up!  But I also think this reflects factionalism and lack of much trans-national worker solidarity to counterbalance the power of transnational corporations. In the US, big transnational corporations and some politicians have for 50+ years mostly succeeded in scapegoating workers in lower-COL countries and pitting US workers against them. Most of the US unions completely fell for this in the 1970s-1990s, pushing to prevent offshoring of manufacturing jobs through contracts and legislation, instead of pushing to unionize the foreign workers. They saw foreign workers as unfair  competition instead of recognizing the corporations and shareholders as the source of the problem.",2025-08-17T20:28:24Z,33

Every job is a challenge and a compromise and the further you get out from your comfort home or country the more challenging it gets. That is where Indian youths who have been pampered at home fail abroad with social adjustment in a new society. They are home sick all the time. They should be concentrating on learning new language, new culture, new skills, seeing new places, experiencing the diversity and nature and even enjoying the quietness and lonliness filled with personal advancement. Glad that you pointed out many of these things here. Europe or any where else is definitely not a bed of roses. Nobody is waiting for you with open arms to give you a job, a home or a car. It is a healthy struggle here all the way minus nepotism, corruption, unequality and injustice which you are hopefully trying to get away from.",2025-08-17T10:46:07Z,0

KOx5ND9NEso,6 Predictions for the 2025 Job Market #careeradvice #jobs #economy,,2025-01-07T23:52:28Z,@AdviceWithErin,"Tips for navigating the 2025 job market:  1️⃣ Embrace AI, especially if you’re a corporate/tech worker. Companies will value the curious and skilled.   2️⃣Consider other industries/smaller companies. Manufacturing, construction & care industries are in demand of workers.   3️⃣ The skilled trades are an AMAZING opportunity because all the boomers are retiring. If you don’t want a laptop job & like working with your hands, consider the trades.   4️⃣ Tap into your network. Use LinkedIn to explore companies & connect with alumni.   5️⃣ This might be the year you finally bet on yourself & start your own company/freelance!

I agree, but I think the scale back will apply to subsets of tech like social media development much more than higher grossing tech fields like aviation and military circles. 2. I think we will take steps toward AI automation, but I’d predict that it’s a longer process that still has a long way to go. Maybe more widespread automation by 2030. 3. Couldn’t agree more. Even if the economy rebounds quickly and booms, companies will be very cautious for the first few quarters, especially if they do a lot of overseas manufacturing. 4. Couldn’t agree more. My company is already flirting with it, but I’m a rare breed who prefers working in the office, so it wouldn’t be a huge shift for me. 5. Couldn’t agree more, but I also predict a lot of bankrupt or deeply in debt people because they jump into entrepreneurship as a reaction to RTO rather than an actual interest in all the responsibilities and headaches that come with business ownership. 6. I’d like to see that, but I doubt it. I can’t see most companies putting more effort into making hiring efficient.  Loved this video though.

Frankly, i think if peole were truly honest they do laundry, walk dogs, cook lunch/dinner, and relax during the day.  Their 8-10 hour day is more like 4-5.  But they get their work done, you say.

When a person can double check for math errors, nonsequitors, factual inaccurates, outdated information, or just generally add humanization to things by rewording them, AI can probably do a lot to remove tedious busywork from people's work lives.

The outsourcing factor seems EXTREMELY RELEVANT as people consider devoting years of their life to learn AI/ Cloud Security/ Network Engineering/ Machine Learning skills only to not be able to land jobs in the future because many of those positions will be outsourced for much cheaper labor. One sub-field that I have looked into that seems to be a little more secure is cybersecurity (at least in the public arena) being that government and public agencies would probably not outsource many positions outside of the country. I would like to know what everybody's thoughts are on this idea, as well as if there are many positions to go into in cybersecurity THAT ARE NOT  HIGH STRESS? All insights are appreciated. Thank you!",2025-10-18T22:10:56Z,1

More than 20 years ago, I started as a school teacher in Singapore (high school math and cs) but left teaching to join tech industry. AT that time, the multimedia side of tech was hot and hip. I left a full government job for multimedia! 😅 over the years, I’ve managed both systems and multimedia development projects. Now, I return to the classroom in Canada, teaching math, cs and tech related subjects in high school. I am looking closely at the scores of unemployed new cs graduates because part of my job is to encourage students to make IT their life long career😅. I think the current situation is an over supply of IT professionals many of whom did not major in AI development and machine learning (robotics) or automation. AI has changed the nature of tech jobs. New graduates must adapt to new realities, adapt to using AI instead, in the work place, do not define what is coding and what is not coding, instead just get the job done in the most efficient time saving way. I also think that most tech jobs are taken by new immigrants (in Canada), only top local graduates from top universities find work or like what you mentioned, those with connections. Over the years, I’ve come to think that cs graduates should be licensed like engineers, accountants, doctors, nurses and teachers. As for current job situation, they should apply into management roles if there are fewer entry level positions. AI has created new positions, even a team of robots need to be managed and maintained. I don’t see IT (including multimedia) management positions going away anytime soon. In fact, coding jobs are not going away either, it’s coding AI software that is in demand, the bar has been raised very high, there is a merger of mechanical, electrical engineering with computer science.",2025-10-13T13:17:30Z,0

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0

I just finished work at 9PM tonight.  I started at 8AM, skipped lunch and breakfast and took a 10m break because my legs were falling asleep.  Tomorrow I will get to do it all over again and nobody is going to notice the extra work I put in.  The management will say, ""take a break"", but they are not going to put the pipeline on hold or say the bugs can wait so even taking a day off fills you with anxiety because you know your project just slipped.  Is that worth 6 figures? Maybe 25 years ago when I first entered the industry.  I love to code, and the tech today is so exciting, but I have missed so much of life because of it.  Now my goal is just to make enough so I can retire early and spend time with my family.  The vast majority though is not people quitting, it's people who are being laid off.  Why? Outsourcing.

Not everyone who works as a developer works in big tech, or has a desire to work in big tech. In fact, I would say THE VAST MAJORITY of developers do not work in big tech. Literally every industry (and probably every company) has a need for developers/technical workers. Instead of whining about how tough things are and quitting the industry entirely because 5 companies treat their employees like numbers, try one of the other thousands of mid to small size companies in pretty much any industry you find interesting. I think people who do this would discover that:  1. You are likely more valued when the company isn't a large tech company, and your immediate team is smaller 2. You have more to offer in helping that particular company grow 3. Benefits (and pay) can be just as good in smaller more established companies 4. More control over the projects you work on and less stress in general 5. You have higher flexibility in how you choose to work 6. A lot more leverage in terms of what you want because they desperately will not want you to leave if you are the go-to person. They aren't going to replace the only person who knows anything about development with AI.

Favourite part of this though was your mention of the joy (or satisfaction) of being deeply involved in problem-solving or refactoring and the feeling of achievement that comes with it.   I think naturally we want to get absorbed in 'deep work' for some of our day - the days when I'm not able to do this, and I'm torn between projects, meetings and piecemeal admin, I tend to end the day a lot more tired and stressed, even if the work itself is less challenging on paper. That's because your brain often craves that bit of extra stimulation, and context-switching takes more out of you. That's the risk we take with AI tooling as well, as it can distance us from the work and problem-solving. I think it's worth stating as well that this isn't just about enjoyment, but using these tools without care an easily weaken a developer's problem-solving mental muscles, which need that practice - and I think this could end up leading to a loss of productivity and developer frustration if that trend continues unchecked.",2025-07-17T08:45:17Z,4

First of all, they've completely ignored the elephant in the room. Companies are hedging their bets towards accelerated automation with A.I., whether the predictions pan out or not, hence  the precarious hiring processes. It's all over the news. This doesn't represent the entirety of the problem, but it definitely shouldn't be ignored. The harsh reality is that employees are a financial liability and a necessary evil to business owners, and if a cheaper, more reliable option exists, they will be foaming at the mouth to take it. If you look at the trend of entry level roles requiring say, 8 years of experience for example, that's a tell to indicate they might be automating away the 'true' entry level roles to A.I. So really, these are not entry level roles at all.  Second, Mitch did make a great point about not posting TikTok videos like this. Granted, it's a bad look and I totally agree that it's cringe, but let's be real, social media is so saturated with these videos anymore, nobody cares, really.  And the way we consume media is constantly changing. In 50 years TikTok will probably be replaced with something else ten times over, so the stuff people post today will go the way of polaroid photos, stuffed in a shoebox somewhere, or the digital equivalent. Sure, it's out there. But really, who cares?    Third, farming college graduates into the restaurant industry is probably a bad idea. The whole reason people go to college is so that they can get a professional job that pays a salary and benefits, and have a shot at an actual career trajectory. Part of what causes career stagnation is not landing a job in their field right out of the gate. The more time that passes before they get that first job, the wider the skills gap grows, and the less likely they'll ever escape the gig work grind. So yeah, spending a couple of years waiting tables when you have a degree in engineering could be the death nail for your career. Your education continues with that first job, and without it, you fall behind. That's why internships are such an essential component of the career ladder. You need to keep your education fresh, and if you take too long of a break, it's over.   Lastly, people who quit their job without another one lined up were probably in the wrong job in the first place. Their physical and mental health are likely in the toilet from burnout, so they are in total fight or flight mode. Going to work is becoming physically painful for them. Something like 80% of people are either not satisfied or actively disengaged with their work as it is. If you would rather starve than continue to go to work, that could be a symptom of a much larger and systemic problem. Anyone who can sit there and say, 'Don't quit your job without another one lined up', maybe has some survivorship bias. They're probably one of the lucky few who are actually satisfied with their position in life. I don't necessarily think it's bad advice, but anyone who is set in their mind on quitting their job without a fallback position is already so far gone that simply telling them not to quit is just pushing them to do it all that much faster. It's like reverse psychology. By saying don't jump, you're basically daring them to do it. I just think that a little more validation and understanding for people in this situation is in order here.",2025-06-11T19:41:45Z,9

It's much harder to fire workers in France and Southern Europe than it is in many other countries (North America, Scandinavia, Australia, etc). For individual firings, workers can often engage in lengthy legal disputes over a single firing, requiring companies to provide detailed evidence. Sometimes dismissals can be reversed if not enoguh evidence is provided. Firings can undoubtedly be arbitrary and difficult on workers but the net result of high firing costs tends to be higher unemployment in general and particularly high youth unemployment.",2025-09-26T11:12:57Z,44

I am a dual Canadian and French citizen, but tax resident in France.  This video is pretty spot on as to how things are set up in France.  If you own a business and earn your revenue through non-salary means, France offers a lot of loopholes which makes it somewhat a tax haven of sorts.  However if you are like most people, you likely earn your living through salary wages and if you are in the middle class, you pay into a social system that is still decent (but no where near as good as it was some years ago), disproportinately to those on low wages and those on the upper echelon of the income ladder.  So you essentially have a system subsidized by the middle class to support both ends of society.  The system needs to change where labour is not taxed as heavily and perhaps this taxation needs to shift towards capital, which currently is moderately-to-lightly taxed.",2025-09-25T19:42:07Z,50

After the war the French used Marshall Plan money to go fight in Southeast Asia and Algeria to regain its colonies. That is like a welfare person taking their handouts and purchasing tattoos and piercings. Scandinavian countries make a ton of money on North Sea oil so their free stuff has more input streams paying for the expense. The number one biggest thing and you never mentioned it probably because of political reasons is that bringing immigrants into the country has been expensive beyond measurement.

A major concern you are not taking into account in these stats is that software development is literally the only career field that can be done by anyone else around the world. Covid taught companies that hey can succeed with remote employees and pay half the rate. It’s a simple supplying demand issue. The Chinese and Indian tech market has saturated the American industry, and the US department of job labor stats don’t consider this. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the future of software development is extremely bleak and is oversaturated. Folks are not getting jobs because there’s 10 times the amount of resumes applying for the same job as there were 5 to 10 years ago on top of this AI has replaced two out of every three developers. All you need is a competent software developer and a good AI tool set and you don’t need as many members on your team. I would never recommend software development as a future career and this is coming from a veteran who’s worked the industry up and down since the 1990s. I’m just glad I retired b fore the gold rush ended. Look elsewhere you will thank me later.",2025-10-13T10:26:52Z,11

I gave up my sales job and came to university to study in CS since 2020 and now it's impossible to find a job as swe. Idk what employers are actually still hiring the grad like me or not.  I guess they only hire dev with 3-5 years of exp though I am sure the job is not as complex like their requirements.  I know finding a job after grad is hard. But at least, I should get several interviews so I will know what employers expect. But now, even not a single interview, so hopeless to find a job even at pay range $60k. I even tried to email some employer that I applied for and said that I could volunteer for them 1 month to see if my skills fit and still no luck.   So hopeless to find the swe job in 2025.

But is 2025 bringing a recovery?",2025-02-01T11:30:41Z,@Denny-Thray,"People blame AI for the mass layoffs in software engineering, but honestly, the bigger factor is H1B.  There are about 1.2 million software engineers working in the U.S. That number hasn’t really changed much over the last decade. So despite all the layoffs, it’s not that software engineering is going away—the jobs are still here. What’s actually changing is who’s holding those jobs.  Right now, there are roughly 600,000 active H1B visa holders working across 50,000 companies in the U.S. About two-thirds of them are in tech, mostly in software engineering. That means around 400,000 of the 1.2 million software engineers in this country are H1B workers.  Now, the cap on new H1B visas is 85,000 per year, but there’s no cap on renewals. So while domestic engineers are getting laid off or locked out of entry-level roles, the number of active H1B engineers just keeps growing.  If you do the math, over the past 8 to 10 years, about 4 to 5 percent of the domestic software workforce has been replaced each year. But that percentage is getting worse. With so many layoffs and people leaving the field, there are maybe 800,000 American engineers left. So if 55,000 new H1Bs are still coming in each year, that’s more like 7 to 8 percent of what's left being replaced annually.  Take Microsoft for example. They’ve gone through multiple rounds of layoffs this year, but also applied for over 6,000 new H1B slots. That’s not unusual either—tons of companies are doing the same.  Now, my opinion: The H1B program was supposed to be a way to bring over highly specialized talent in cases where the U.S. was lacking. It was never meant to be a tool for replacing domestic professionals with cheap labor. But that’s exactly how it’s being used.  And we’re seeing the results. Code quality is dropping. Technical debt is piling up. Onboarding is slower, product velocity is declining, and morale is shot. Engineers, both domestic and foreign, are burning out. The whole thing is starting to feel like a bubble. And at some point, it’s going to pop.",2025-07-05T21:55:47Z,2
