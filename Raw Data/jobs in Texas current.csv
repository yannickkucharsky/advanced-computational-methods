Took the job offer from my uncle when i was 17, worked there for a year and a half while going to night school, loved it at first.  The only issue is working with my uncle sucks, hes the type to put others down to make himself look good and can never be wrong.  It was the same with one of the old guys there, the young generations is so weak willed and never wants to do shit, all i had to hear everyday at lunch.  Started eating in my truck every day, talking a lot less, just putting earbuds and going to work, i liked the hanging with the other guys my age, we were all in the same boat somewhat but they were a couple years older so they werent completely relateable.  It got to the point of me dreading waking up and going to work, not because of hard it was, the 11 hour shift and then going to school for 3 or 4 hours, it wasnt the shoveling gravels for 9 hours straight at 103F outside, it was the fact i had to get up and deal with those assholes for hours.  I finally finished night school and put in my 2 weeks to get ready for college to get my bachelors to become a therapist, it was the great 2 months of my life being free from everything for once.

Several cars had skidded off the road right in front of us, and were driving so slow. Eventually some kindly trucker pulled up next to us and gestured for us to follow him with his lights. He led us to an off-ramp where we were able to find and get a hotel. After getting us safely to the off ramp, he went straight back on the road. He probably saved our life that night. An driverless truck would’ve just left us to wreck and freeze — probably would’ve caused the wreck by failing to account for the conditions.

I visited Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Galveston. I’ll never set foot in Texas again if I can possibly help it. I knew a lot of people who moved there from the Bay Area would regret it. There just isn’t enough to do within easy access for enough of the year. In the Bay Area, you can take a day trip to go skiiing from December until March. You can sail or kayak or windsurf the rest of the year from scores of launches along the Bay and all along the Delta. You can comfortably hike year round, play tennis outdoors, bike in Golden Gate Park. In Dallas, I couldn’t do anything outdoors during the summertime. It was 90 degrees at night. I know Austin wasn’t any more comfortable. Stanford and Cal are two of the best universities in the world, creating a stimulating, invigorating environment. Unfortunately, Oakland has lost its professional sports franchises, but you still have the 49ers, Giants, Warriors, Sharks and Earthquakes, all the major sports. Austin? None of them. The food is better, world famous in San Francisco. More variety, fresh fruit and vegetables year round, pretty cheap too. There’s just no comparison in my mind. Sure real estate might have been cheaper, and probably still is, but I don’t want to stay indoors looking at the walls all day. More space just means more space to clean. A bigger garden means more weeds to pull. A riding lawn mower is not as much fun as a kayak. People severely misjudged what life in Texas is like.  So I’ll tell you. it sucks.

My friend works at the bank and told me about overdraft. And then the box of Pandora opened. I promise you for a good 4-5 months I was overdrafting up to $300 and when my paycheck hit it would automatically take out what i owed. And then I'd be short $300 bucks and the cycle would start again. I easily gave the bank like $3000 in a matter of months and probably $500 in only overdraft fees. The same friend that told me about it called in as me to cancel the overdraft 😂 thank God I ain't been through that  in like 10 years. life's good save get a 401k and don't indulge in the bs,2025-12-24T06:12:21Z,40

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

Pretty much every study ever done shows people are more productive when working from home, but they can’t control you when you’re at home, and they _hate_ it. Theoretically, as long as you’re performing well, getting your work done and hitting goals, they should be happy. But employees who work from home can almost always do that and still do stuff like… run errands, take a shower, hell, get laid. Companies don’t like that. They want to own you. If you have second job, their control over your income source and health insurance goes away. They don’t like that. They’ll fight tooth and nail to keep this from happening.

I've read a lot of comments about senior command staff being the biggest problem. I totally agree. The world thinks so much of police, but they have no idea what it is really like. They have no idea what people will do to each other to get promoted,  to get that special detail, to get that detective position. People would always say to me, ""you guys don't get paid enough..."" You are correct. But not for the reasons you think. I carried a gun, wore body armor and was trained to deal with all sorts of threats from domestic encounters, three hundred pound drunks, meth heads and active shooters. But there is no armor, no training that can protect you from a weaponized administration. The world would be shocked at the things I have seen.  But now I have a nice job and get a check every month from my department's retirement that reminds me that I don't have those problems any more.   All the best, young lady.

The only way that is even a livable wage is living in a poor/very rural area. Cost of living has surged and people are out of touch with how much it cost to live.   Rent where i live is an average of 1.6k-2k monthly where I live and a car payment is an average of 650 dollars which is necessary in the US as public transportation lacks anywhere outside a major city walls. That means you spend 66.25 percent on your income just on those bills alone. Add in taxes, emergencies, and all other bills you can’t make a living.",2025-08-21T12:58:06Z,25

I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt.

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting.. So I think that I would never regret studying it, in fact I'm doing a master degree in Accounting atm, and I'm planning on pursue the CPA position.",2025-09-30T09:11:25Z,6

I did it for about 7 months this year to bridge a gap, and it was pretty chill. At first I did app support, which was annoying if there was yet another big bug customers caled about, then I switched teams to customer service for the local expo and congress center and the only time that it was actually busy was in the days during and leading up to larger expos. The rest of the time, I wouldn't even get calls for an hour or more and could just fart around on my phone while answering the occasional email. It was a great lazy girl job.

It's okay to be lazy, especially when it comes to phone call jobs.  I've been working from home for 21 years, and the 3 companies I did phone work for, were so mentally draining. The calls were b2b and nonstop my entire shift. I don't mind steady calls, but not nonstop calls. I would love to get at least a minute breather between calls. Therefore, I would work evenings and weekends. So,  can you please provide the name of the remote job you're booking the appointments for?",2025-09-23T21:07:53Z,1

Summers are usually miserably hot, the wind and dust storms are horrible. I've never seen a tornado, but hail is likely to cause very expensive damage. It's flat and not that attractive. Some years its mostly green but it's usually brown and dead looking from a lack of water. The pay in Lubbock is horribly low. On the upside, housing is lower than most places, though not as low as it once was and no longer low enough to justify the abysmal wages. But the worst is the lack of public land that I'm used to in New Mexico. No public hiking, camping, hunting, ect. There is nothing to do here unless you are wealthy and if you are you usually travel elsewhere, like New Mexico or Colorado. Oh and the sales tax? 8.25% is abusive. I frequently make high dollar purchases in New Mexico to pay a lower sales tax. (screw you tx).",2025-09-06T04:14:16Z,176

I'll tell ya, if you say it's cheap, maybe yes but your pay is less than half than what I made back in NJ. Lot's of poor folks here living in RV's and Trailer Parks. They don't tell you how many millions are living like this down here and how many more are homeless. The ones in here that live inside the actual  cities/highly urban areas will say different things to their benefit. The minimum wage down here in Texas is 25 years behind ($8.25/hour) before tax compared to NJ that was the minimum wage in 2000!   So yeah, unless you're a Mark Cuban, Elon Musk or some millionaire/billionaire or retired with 401K and SSI etc...good luck.   Not everyone is a 1% percenter here.

It was the temperatures getting down into the single digits for multiple days. Colder areas are better prepared for this, but in Texas most people have either natural gas or electric heating, primarily heat pumps. The problem with heat pumps, and why they're not relied on heavily in colder areas, is that they're only effective down to about 20ºF. Below that, they switch into ""emergency heating"" which is a form of resistance heating and only about 20-25% as efficient as a heat pump. So the grid saw a massive spike in energy usage in a small timeframe. Something that doesn't happen in colder areas where people would never consider using electrical resistance heating as it's too expensive.",2025-10-10T16:42:51Z,4

They’re not aggressive and just sit there while you deal with them. 😄  You’re right about the property taxes, but regarding the power shortages during Winter Storm Uri — that was an unprecedented event. Texas doesn’t get that kind of weather often, so it’s not practical to maintain all the equipment year-round for something that rare. Texans just hunker down and get through it.  Texas also has huge medical research centers and hospitals, plus strong healthcare innovation. And yes, cedar season is rough — “cedar fever” from Ashe Juniper (which actually came up from Mexico) hits hard every fall.  Just feels like your video had a bit of an agenda.

One day my boss put a hiring sign in the front window and i asked her how many people we were loking to hire. She told me zero. Appsrently around 2010 CT created a law stating that all companies had to advertise that they were hiring. Part of that law was that no one could be denied an application if the store used paper ones, if not you had to explain to the person how to apply online. It was supposedly meant to help decrease all types of prejudice during the hiring process. It made no sense to me because if a manager was prejudice, that persn they didnt like would never make it past the first interview. Anyways, all it did was fool people into thinking we were actually hiring when we werent. It wasted everyone involved time. I tried explaining the law to people when they would come back in or call about the application they dropped off weeks ago. People were pissed.

That they should be grateful for what they have and that they can replace them on a whim. Sure, they possibly could, however, that doesn't account for training, the risk of a new hire possibly not fitting in or being even more of a pain to work with, and they already have as few people hired as possible, so they don't want to fire you, because even if they get a replacement, that's a role that's not going to be functioning properly, if at all for a while when you're gone.

We also get a lot of right leaning people from other states moving here now. We also get Mexican nationals who are here legally (some even illegally) who really hate other immigrants and adopt the MAGA culture. Even the human smugglers were spreading pro MAGA conspiracies (Back in 2016 some dude told me his smuggler buddy was bringing in Middle Eastern guys who were preparing for Hillary to win so they could cause some chaos). The southern tip of Texas was a blue stronghold but the topic of immigration has ALWAYS been neglected by the Democrats so anyone leaning left feels discouraged.

I think a black migration take 2 needs to happen and it shouldn’t be to any of the “traditional black cities”.  I think 100s of thousands should look to relocate to either upstate New York, Delaware county PA, Chester county PA, Western Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, or all of the above.  I think Black American professionals and their extended families need to move at one time and restart and rebuild safe respectful communities there.  Inside the safety of democratically controlled states.  Get away from these gerrymandered toxic maga states who poison us, steal our votes and refuse to hire us.  If in large numbers Black Americans repopulate North East America the number of Representatives fit those blue states will go up.  That’s how Black Americans can make the Democratic Party listen and actually forge policies that help our communities.  But if we keep trying to hold on to the south, living in these Republican controlled states we will economically, politically and sadly literally die because that’s what they want.",2025-08-21T22:36:12Z,18

Unfortunately , too many people don't even know that their new house is located in an MUD till after they've moved in.  That is because the postal address for a subdivision could say something like Katy or Georgetown and still be outside of the city limits.  The utility costs for homeowners who live in MUD's can be astronomical, AND they can assess their own property tax.  In fact , for a person with a $300,000 house , the annual MUD tax could be as much as $2700.  If you are thinking of buying a house in suburban Texas , make sure to ask about this.",2025-11-30T19:17:27Z,9

Developer charges interest on the monies spent until repaid from bonds issued, and those bonds will require repayment (typically) in 30yrs.  In my neighborhood, the MUD tax on a 2200sqft home appraised at $440K is almost $4K per year.  Just for utility taxes.

For larger firms, this is worse than contacting recruiter directly. Interviewing screening and such are usually side things for hiring managers and are more focused on their primary senior job duties. They will more than likely get annoyed and ignore it completely. Especially these days where applicant to role ratios are wack. Chances are they already have dozens of folks contacting them directly.  Networking helps a lot: job fairs, friends, family, hobby groups. Have multiple people look over your resume. Practice interviewing. Other than that it's a number game.",2025-10-16T17:51:47Z,1

I’ve had a few interviews. But no job offer. I even reached out to alumni and employees in the industry on LinkedIn. But they rarely reply back and when they do, they just repeat the same advice and say how they’ll reach out if their company will hire. These past 4 months have been the worst months of my life. Legit can’t fall asleep at night because of worry of being unemployed and not being able to pay bills on time or support myself. I’ve had multiple emotional outbursts and panic attacks in my room where I broke my ps5 controller in half randomly and even tore my shirt off my body once. All because of not getting a chance from the hundreds of jobs I applied and interviewed at. College was a joke and I regret wasting four years of my life there smh. For now I’m just going to apply to fast food and retail jobs until I figure my life out.

Companies will value the curious and skilled.   2️⃣Consider other industries/smaller companies. Manufacturing, construction & care industries are in demand of workers.   3️⃣ The skilled trades are an AMAZING opportunity because all the boomers are retiring. If you don’t want a laptop job & like working with your hands, consider the trades.   4️⃣ Tap into your network.

I agree, but I think the scale back will apply to subsets of tech like social media development much more than higher grossing tech fields like aviation and military circles. 2. I think we will take steps toward AI automation, but I’d predict that it’s a longer process that still has a long way to go. Maybe more widespread automation by 2030. 3. Couldn’t agree more. Even if the economy rebounds quickly and booms, companies will be very cautious for the first few quarters, especially if they do a lot of overseas manufacturing. 4. Couldn’t agree more. My company is already flirting with it, but I’m a rare breed who prefers working in the office, so it wouldn’t be a huge shift for me. 5. Couldn’t agree more, but I also predict a lot of bankrupt or deeply in debt people because they jump into entrepreneurship as a reaction to RTO rather than an actual interest in all the responsibilities and headaches that come with business ownership. 6. I’d like to see that, but I doubt it. I can’t see most companies putting more effort into making hiring efficient.  Loved this video though.

Texas fans/alumni love the fact that horns down is thrown around even in games that Texas isn’t playing in.

Soviets helped us, that doesn't mean that we should support Putin knowing how his record is and how we as Indians are literally fueling Russian economy.   We also need to know Europeans as Australians have supported us on many issues and we have also, not been loyal to them.  Our racism is so at peak that we don't spare the Africans either.  That's just why not even our neighbours like Nepal, Sri Lanka or Bhutan are also not siding with us but going to the China camp.   I wish for all good for America but now, it will be wise if the US starts imposing taxations on remittances of Indians working on the US who are a wealthy group as well.   Our disdain for Muslims also, is a factor, despite knowing that the Gulf Countries employ almost 10 million Indians with jobs yet we do not spare them from our comments.  Is this what we want as a global image for us?

When I was in if you were an initial entry recruit you had to complete basic, AIT and any advanced training as part of your contract.  In other words you had to make it to you permanent party unit before payout. A bonus can also be offered at re-up time, but that's a different story.   A five year enlistment will pretty much be a piece of cake to honorably discharged vets.  For civilians not used to that kind of commitment it could be a deterrent, you have to show some kind of dedication to this, it does sound like a military type sign on, I love it, except I'm to old now.

As a local DFW company, we've worked with countless new homeowners right after they move in. One of the best ""first upgrades"" we see people do to make their new house feel truly finished is to get the garage floor coated. It protects the concrete from the start and makes a huge difference in keeping dust and dirt from getting tracked into the home.  Thanks for sharing such great local insights!
