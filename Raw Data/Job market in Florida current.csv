The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

I really feel badly for lil kids whose parents no longer have that option, some of the stuff may be junk to some yes, but to a kid whose never been able to play barbies, that dupe barbie was the best thing since sliced bread. when you have never had to live like that you shouldnt go around saying that people are stupid for buying junk telling them to stop buying junk when its their only way to give their kids a bday or christmas with gifts like everybody else. i am very very worried about this country, and until TRUMP himself gets out of his own head and makes an effort to understand the people who helped win him his throne, things will keep getting worse, he will keep making decisions based off a life of luxury, he has no clue what its like to HAVE NO CHOICE but buy cheap to survive, he expects everybody to be able to make themselves into billionaires and the truth is we CANT not when you got billionaires like him making all the choices based off their own life instead of basing those choices on the lives of your most vulnerable people. because the consequences hit them first and foremost,  and they cannot afford any more consequences, people are at the edge of the cliff and anymore will push them on over that edge and thats when kids start getting taken from parents that can no longer afford to raise them, then your foster care program will be full to its max of kids without homes which our goernment and ourselves will fit the bill for later on. these tariffs have also messed up things like churches giving out free boxes of food, its caused homeless shelters to have to shut their doors, the ripples are rippling out and hitting in places we never thought about, places that rely soley on donations and cheaper products to feed the homeless and the poor arent able to get those things anymore, stores refuse to give anything away now, and those who broker deals with churches and such arent brokering those deals because they say they can no longer afford it, and these places arent able to buy things straight up off the shelf they HAVE to get it cheap or free or they cant get it and so people wont even have that as an option anymore if something dont change soon and fast. i pray i am wrong and he sees it before its too late and he jumps on it and makes these companies eat a lil more or else we are all doomed including HIM.",2025-08-08T09:15:30Z,5

When we got there, housing prices were reasonable. Insurance costs were manageable. Auto insurance was high but not too high. It  didn't start to get hot until late May, really hot after June 15. It would start cooling in mid October. The rest of the time the climate was ideal. But that changed. We started getting more 90 degree days as early as February. We were getting hot weather up until Thanksgiving. Look up the number of 90 degree days in a year in some parts of Florida. And like people say, its not the heat its the humidity. 90 degrees and 80% humidity during the day and 88 degrees with 95% humidity at night. Traffic congestion in any metro area in Florida is horrible. Even the I4 corridor between Tampa and the east coast can be stop and go for miles around the Disney properties. Hurricanes, tropical storms and lightening strikes are frequent. You can still see the stars and bars flown in lots of places in Florida.  What's good about Florida. Sports teams, major entertainers play in all the major cities, when the weather is nice it's great. Good parks everywhere, easy cycling, lots of amenities. Plenty of 'big city' ambiance. Good restaurants and everywhere is close to water for boating, fishing, etc. We moved to southern Virginia. No snow, more rural, less congestion. Lower cost of living probably because there is less to do. Some people don't mind the heat and Florida is ideal for them. For my wife and I, the heat and being indoors so much of the time to avoid the heat, finally got us to move.",2025-05-28T17:25:36Z,12

Some new Florida ...",2025-02-06T17:00:10Z,@NicholasCampbell-pe3db,"I have lived in Canberra, Australia for almost 35 years due to a fairly unusual set of circumstances. However, in another life far, far, away, I lived in Florida for approximately 30 years, 1960 to 1990. It truly was a great place to grow up apart from rarely having serious cold weather which I do like sometimes and do get where I live in Australia. The phrase that I would use to describe Florida today is 'complete lack of balance'. It is deficient in so many aspects. Environmentally, governance issues, traffic nightmares, overcrowding, I could go on and on but the narrator pretty much nailed many of the social ills of the state as they exist today. Just one small example that points out how the place has changed and as I come back fairly infrequently these days, I really notice changes. One stark example is the following: I lived in Orlando for 22 years before moving here, Jacksonville for 8 years before that. Hwy 50 (Colonial Drive) goes east-west right through the middle of the state from Brevard County all the way to the west coast, ending in Hernando County. In the late 1970's before 3 devastating freezes in the 1980's exacted a savage toll on Central Florida's citrus industry, you went from Orange County into Lake County entering just east of Clermont. Highway 50 was at that time in that area, a two lane road in the rural areas generally with light traffic. I can honestly remember seeing as you headed west, vast citrus groves for as far as the eye could see, literally. It was an amazing sight to see, now it is, counting both sides, an 8 to as much as a 12 lane road and the citrus groves in that region have totally disappeared, replaced by hundreds and hundreds of commercial buildings on both sides of the road. In fact, due to citrus greening, the state's production of what used to be the sweetest, most delicious citrus you ever ate, has plummeted to levels last seen in the mid 1930's. A once very proud industry is virtually on its knees today due to hurricanes, freezes, costs to grow crops, and diseases of myriad sorts. What has also happened there with invasive species, the draining of swamps, completely inappropriate building over much of the state and just the train wreck that the state has become is heartbreaking, especially for those of us who remember a place that was so much different and better than what those who live there today are likely experiencing. I am so blessed to now live in the city that in 2014 was voted the #1 city on the planet in which to live, the Capital of Australia. I will always have a fond place in my heart for Florida, as it once was. Good luck to all of you who reside in the state now. It can't be easy to do so.",2025-02-08T04:44:08Z,14

We're in Texas and the cost of living in natural disasters on the coast are affecting us, too.   We've noticed that there is an increasing push to get family medicine and general practitioners into Texas and Florida as the country sees more and more family doctors retire and family health care deserts expand.   As medical schools, physician assistant master's degree programs, and nurse practitioner programs become increasingly ethnically diverse and more female, we're noticing that fewer of those students are interested in being in red states.  If they have a choice, people will avoid going to places where they are not welcome or safe.  We're an LGBT/interracial family, and we feel much less safe and much less welcome in Texas, where we live, and have no plans to venture into Florida for the same reasons.  We've had a few headhunters try to entice my wife into interviews with corporate healthcare chains in Florida, and we won't consider it at all.  I hope Floridians can make the necessary changes to their state to make it more affordable and attractive again.",2025-09-01T16:32:32Z,8

And when hurricanes came through, we never evacuated, not even the last one-however, that one we were out of power starting as soon as the hurricane came in and for over a week after, which was crazy!   We live in a large elderly community, and there was no reason for being without that long! Our electricity goes out much to frequently here.  The large electric company hasn't updated their system here in many years! And, very expensive. We are moving out of Florida because the current governor only caters to the wealthy, and as far as I have seen the elderly, lower income people are left behind.   Florida has, and still is, being built up far close to the Gulf and Atlantic waters, that should have been stopped years ago.  Further, homes, and all other buildings built way to close to each other, and local roads can't even widen, causing all of the horrible traffic issues!  Lack of common sense, greed, is very apparent. We have decided to leave Florida, this summer!  Also, the prices for food, utilities, is ridiculous, and far to many rude, unfriendly people.  Further, medical care is greatly lacking quality, and some areas it is difficult to find English speaking doctors-to clearly understand what they are even saying, which causes me concern on how much they understand of what I am telling them! And yes, many overbook making not only a ridiculous long, hours, wait,  but also the medical staff stressed and unfriendly. I have also lived in many other states in America, and  after all my years of calling Florida my home- saying now- good- by! Florida used to be a very friendly place, young and old alike, not anymore!

The problem is they are the same people that they were back at their former homes, that they simply brought their problems with them. Divorce and crime rates often are worse in warmer climates, and now you have a collection of miserable, angry or sad people huddling together in a new place.

And the office vibes are now ATROCIOUS because the raises are not equal. We all got new titles based on an assessment of our work and our personalities, and each title has a different base pay.

Two people have been fired for mouthing off and giving the worst attitude about not getting as high a raise as other people. I'm not about protecting billionaire executives but in this job market I cannot comprehend being unable to keep your head down, do your work, and just be grateful you're at a company that constantly keeps us ahead of inflation AND has great benefits.

Employers dangle “opportunities” that are really just overworked, under-resourced roles with no long-term security. Automation and AI are replacing human labor faster than new roles are being created, and gig work is treated like a solution when it’s really just a way to avoid giving people benefits. It’s no wonder so many people feel hopeless or burnt out before they even get started. I don’t blame anyone who doesn’t want to work.

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us. They are too busy competing to see who can burn it down the fastest.",2025-08-06T14:39:37Z,57

The federal government has purposefully crashed the economy to forestall entitlement reforms, tax reform, immigration reform, and industrial policy reform.

So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life.

Despite ...,2025-11-15T00:21:37Z,@gwgux,"When a company wants 3-5 years of experience for an entry level job: 1. They aren't actually hiring. They're posting jobs pad the ""jobs created"" numbers. They're going to use it as leverage to say ""they can't find qualified people"" and pressure the government to allow them to hire more non-citizens on visa for cheaper (ex: the H1B visa program). OR, they're going to use it as an excuse for diving more into automation to justify replacing those jobs with AI and make someone at the company look good by ""solving a problem"" with AI.  2. They don't want people fresh out of school. You've all probably seen the BS reasons given for this. Look it up if you haven't, but there are companies that don't want to hire Gen Z workers fresh out of school right now. They often won't come out and say it because they don't want to spend money handling the backlash, but it's essentially what they're doing. As a reminder, age discrimination is LEGAL for anybody under 40. It's not until you hit age 40 and above that you now have a legal right against age discrimination in the US.  3. They're keeping wages down. Someone with 3-5 years of work experience is worth more than an entry level job salary, but if they can't get a higher position somewhere, they'll have to take the lower paying ""entry level"" position even if the ""other duties as assigned"" aspect of the job is actually something that would normally be done at a higher position. The reason why this is significant is because wages DO get tracked. Companies look at that data and think about ways they can squeeze more work out of every individual and if they can spread some work normally done by someone in a higher position among entry level workers to ""give them experience"" while keeping the amount they pay to get that work done lower, they consider it as ""win/win"". The bright eyed, eager entry level worker gets more exposure and experience and the company gets to pay less to get the work done. Now they can use AI to take more of the work load as well.  This isn't anything new. The same thing happened in the fallout of the dotcom bubble bust in the early 2000s. Younger GenX and older Millenials went through the same thing. Even before AI, people were writing software for automation. It IS unfair. It ruined those people's lives and prevented them from having a good start after school. Millions of people were screwed just by the timing of them entering the workforce. There was NO help for them. There will be NO help for GenZ entering the workforce today. In addition to that millions of other older workers had their careers destroyed as well. It was a dark time and then just as things showed signs of getting better, the Great Recession happened in the late 2000s.  Today, we're also heading to a major recession. It's a VERY bad sign when AI spending from few companies is literally propping up the US economy right now. The writing is on the wall. This situation may improve somewhat for a few people who finally break into the workforce, but a recession is coming to knock them and everyone else down.  I REALLY wish there was a better outlook coming, but there isn't. All any of us can do (young and older workers alike) is keep on trying. Giving up won't pay the bills or put food on the table. After we get through the coming dark times, things will eventually get better for everyone, but we have to keep trying and sometimes fight to get there.",2025-11-16T17:27:49Z,20

Yes, companies are reporting record profits while job growth is stagnant — but the real issue goes deeper. With real-time analytics and constant quarterly-report pressure, executives are fixated on hitting KPIs every 90 days instead of building anything long-term.

They’re not generating those profits through innovation or sustained growth; they’re squeezing the organization to make the numbers look good.  And now that AI can replace a lot of lower-level work, I don’t know if this cycle ever reverses.

The monthly US jobs report, officially the Employment Situation Summary, is released on the first Friday of every month at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Monthly job numbers are revised because the initial figures are preliminary estimates that become more accurate as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) receives more responses from the monthly employer surveys. The BLS also incorporates more comprehensive state unemployment insurance records in a larger ""benchmark revision"" annually to provide a definitive picture of the labor market. These revisions, which are standard practice to ensure data accuracy, improve the timeliness of the preliminary numbers while still accounting for incomplete data collection.  Trump or any of his supporters that question why the revisions are made can google learn.",2025-09-06T14:22:35Z,4

Apply for thousands of fake indeed  tax-write-off listing jobs per week to document in order to receive said benefit.

These include the overall phenomenon called ""structural unemployment.""  Some economists have predicted this for decades because of its Malthusian essence.  Too many people, not enough jobs.  It will never return to what was.  It's not part of normal economic cycles that the experts are so fond of citing. It's exacerbated by AI and robotics.  Unless the government was proactive in planning to make society more socialistic, and improving conditions for citizens, then it's a down hill slide towards a plutocracy. Unfortunately that's the widening chasm between the rich and the poor, leaving the mid-class in tatters trying to maintain their standard of living in a country where the average person is involved in a non-consensual relationship with an economy hell bent on fleecing the shit out of people.  The automobile is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on a populace. Just add up all the costs inherent in the operation of your car and hang up and drive.  The fender bender industry wants you on your phone, with headlights unique to each model and absurd prices for injection molded parts with insane margins. Back to the acyclic economic milieu in which we exist.  The end of the petroleum age means that we are seeing prices rise based on a truer calculation of embedded costs.   The slow death of urban core retail means that commercial real estate is getting shitty, and that sector has anchored funds and such for years.   Bankers are slow to adjust. Every company is squeezing everything for revenue, meaning the firings and the terrible job market are the tip of the iceberg. The guy who got voted in isn't doing anything to help you folks that believed the rhetoric.  He just wants to aggrandize himself and his cronies by reviving the polluting of our country while bad mouthing renewable energy because of its effect on the ""landscape.""   Since when has he given a shit about the natural world? Has he visited an open pit mine recently.  He has doubled his net worth over the last 6-18 months, while most US citizens are suffering.   Make no mistake: He doesn't give a shit about any of us, unless you're part of the war machine dominated by the Big 5 and go to Davos or Tetons.   Over Easter he dismissed us all and said ""just enjoy your life"" in a display of such callous indifference the average person's plight as to be obscene. He has begun to take away the basic right to free speech and his attacks on people smarter than he is who criticize what is happening is truly frightening.

In 1980, you could buy a house ($47,000) on a minimum wage ($3.10 per hour). Rent was an average of $243 per month. Groceries was $40 a week/$160 per month.  In 2025, the cost to buy a house is 9.8 times what it was in 1980, at a national average of $417,000. Yet minimum wage is only $7.25 an hour, up from $3.10 per hour. It used to be $80,000 per year was considered middle class; now middle class is $185,000.  Point is, the old thinking is for an old age. The Industral Age has given way to the Information Age, and no longer do the old ways work, simply because the old ways has put way too many people in a hole they will never get out of.  Minimum yearly salary is not $35,000 anymore, for even entry-level. My guess is that minimum yearly salary should be around $50,000 per year.

axVQ8mZESuU,Why the Job Market is Worse Than Everyone Thinks,,2025-08-01T16:05:57Z,@AdviceWithErin,"🗞️ 👀 Some news: job growth came in lower than expected, and May + June were both revised way down.  (Like… by a combined 258,000 jobs 😬) Unemployment nudged up to 4.2%—still relatively low, but paired with sluggish hiring, it’s clear: the market’s tightening.  So if you’re job hunting right now, here’s some good old fashion AdviceWithErin tips:   1. Embrace AI, especially if you’re in a corporate role. You don’t have to force it, just express that you’re “ai curious” and willing to adapt (because a LOT of people aren’t and this will make you stand out) 🤖  2. Build relationships. The hidden job market is where all the delicious juicy chill high paying jobs are. They’re found through talking to actual people. Message a few folks on LinkedIn this week just to say hi 👋 💬  3. Get specific about your brand. You’re not just a project manager. You’re a “dedicated project manager who uses strong interpersonal skills to lead cross department teams to deliver creative projects to clients on time and within scope” or whatever lol.  You got this !! 👏🏼 #jobmarket",2025-08-01T16:11:09Z,420

Some people have even been out there for 2 years and been forced to gig work just to get by but yet no one is talking about this on the news and the department of labor isn’t making any adjustments with the lengths of unemployment benefits which is extremely short.

When you see rents dropping at the same time homebuyer demand is at 30-year lows, it signals a deep and persistent demand problem. That weakness is now showing up across the country — rents are falling, price cuts are rising, and more markets are entering outright decline.  For renters and first-time buyers, this is great news. It means 2026 is shaping up to be the most affordable year in housing since before the pandemic.  The downside? This is a brutal environment for investors and landlords. Rents are falling across the once-booming Sun Belt, compressing yields at the same time taxes and insurance keep climbing. Investors are selling more, buying less, and re-evaluating their portfolios.  But there are still opportunities. In the video, I broke down my top 3 most affordable markets heading into 2026 — places where you can still buy a home or rental for $1,000/month or less on your mortgage payment (including taxes).  To find more markets where the numbers still work, go to www.reventure.app and upgrade to the premium package. Premium gives you full access to Cap Rates, Rental Rates, and Home Value-to-Rent data, all mapped down to the ZIP Code.

Unfortunately the insurance issue scares people. Insurance has doubled as fast as the mortgage rates. And if a seller has a roof near 10 years old they are forced to pay $20K and up to replace the roof. Nobody will pay for a house where they have to put on a new roof just to get insurance. Without insurance you cannot get a mortgage. Only a cash buyer can afford to do that. Its asking a lot of people. The city or state may have to move in to help save some of these areas.,2025-09-24T21:19:40Z,2

What is EQUALLY at fault? Hiring from the overseas CHEAP population. They are taking most of our jobs here right now. I see it happening everyday. My employer is a fortune 500 company and their goal is 70% global and 30% US workers. They've been laying off thousands of US workers every quarter and hiring for those same positions in India and Phillipines. It's disgusting! I'm  not just talking about IT - at my company, that's a small portion - its the peoole in the offices and on phones, including nurses on the phones..  its bad!

Construction is about 5% of gdp. You tell me if contracting construction activity is tantamount to a recession. To my mind, we have been in a recession since the architectural billing started contracting which is always a herald of recession in the rest of the economy a few months later. Construction is the most volatile and fluid part of the economy. It’s also the most sensitive to instability. A sharp contraction in construction absolutely sends shockwaves throughout everything else. The recession we are feeling is the consequence of halted and deferred construction projects.

As a young person myself, we are all told that if you want to make an income you need to get a job. But to get a decent paying job or a white collar job you'll need a degree. Once you have the degree you'll need work experience which you'll most likely gain through internships where there is no pay or very little and will mostly likely be utilized as a tool.

Any change in manufacturing locations will require capital investments, often significant ones. These involve significant loans, and even if interest rates are low now, a lot of these are variable rates, meaning they go up when prime lending rate does. When this happens, payments required will significantly increase, something that can ruin ROIs at best and send companies into instant default at worst.  My point is that for companies to make major changes to manufacturing, they need to spend a lot of capital, something they don't want to do with lots of economic uncertainty. Manufacturing that was planning to leave will probably be more likely to stay (as described with Nissan),  but not many will come back until there's stability in the forecast, something the current administration seems anathema to.",2025-04-08T17:22:20Z,7

Since then it’s been a race to the bottom with every company and every blue collar or trades job paying less and less with increasingly more inflation. You could barely support yourself in a slum with a run down car on what an entry level warehouse salary is worth. And the raises are garbage.

Something is clearly breaking under the surface.  But here’s the twist: layoffs are still historically low, so the unemployment rate hasn’t moved much. At the same time, GDP growth and stock prices are still high. That’s why it doesn’t feel like a recession yet.  The impact I’m watching most closely is on housing. As job losses pick up and more households are forced to sell, housing demand will crack further. We’re already seeing a housing recession in half the U.S.—with values dropping in places like Florida, Texas, and Arizona. The question is: how long before the pain spreads to other states?  👉 Head to Reventure App  to track the data in your ZIP code.

Do Not follow the housing prices down. Better first to drop than stuck. 2. If you've got enough equity drop your price below the comps in your neighborhood for a quick sale.

Consumers are spending more but buying less that's why it appears that consumers are ignoring inflation. They just have to keep paying more for the things they need to buy. I think if you look at it by category that discretionary spending is down for everyone but the very wealthy. The very wealthy are spending more because their wealth keeps going up.

There’s a growing skew between full-time and part-time jobs, with the former decreasing and the latter increasing, which is masking the job recession we’re already in. This is happening because when people lose their jobs now, many move into the gig economy (e.g., Uber, etc.) as part-timers and/or independent contractors and don’t file for unemployment because they can often earn more without it. It’s also causing a major distortion in the BLS business birth/death model employment growth estimates. The BDM looks at new businesses formed based on employer ID applications and assumes that each new business will hire a certain number of employees. But the problem is that most of the new businesses being formed are independent contractors going into the gig economy, who do not hire employees. As a result, unemployment figures reported by the BLS likely vastly underestimate both unemployment and underemployment, and the real unemployment rate is probably already deeply recessionary, in the 6–8% range. It really is different this time.",2025-12-08T14:04:42Z,2

So, maybe that decouples the employment situation from the ""home sales"" situation?  Lots of younger people don't own houses.

This is causing a lag of layoffs and new unemployment claims. Some folks lucked out with 6 months or more severance.   Weird to see this when past it was not the case.

He taught the basics from the textbooks, but added in a lifetime of expertise in the industry, as well as personal observations on how to survive through the ups and downs of the economic cycles. He hammered home the importance of compound interest, long term effects of inflation, time in the markets, and how market psychology impacts the economy. Also, never fight the trends.

Let's say it's a big big job you know billion-dollar job. They bid. They bid these jobs by going off of the prices that they see present time and they even account for a small percentage for inflation but there's no way in hell they're going to account for 50% inflation due to a tariff. So if someone did a job for a billion dollars and they won the job and they're already broken ground and been on the job for a year, once Trump puts these tariffs on steel and copper and aluminum, it's basically going to shut that job down because the job was bid for a certain amount of money and now the tariffs are going to make that bid basically flush down the toilet and probably double the cost. So the jobs are going to end up shutting down because these jobs when they do get bid and a general contractor is awarded, that money that whoever the CEO or whoever is building the building or building the complex doesn't just have the cash in his pocket and it's painted out they usually get financed through these big hedge funds or special companies. So when they go get the financing they have to explain how much the buildings going to cost to build and how much it'll be worth once it's finished and then how much it'll be generating throughout the years and then how much it might be worth 10 years from now and blah blah blah they bring this all to the finances to show them that it's a good investment to loan them this money to build this building so what happens is, they agreed to invest a certain amount of money which whatever which is whatever the bid was and maybe a little extra for emergencies. So what happens with these tariffs is let's say the finances are financing a billion dollars and they've already given up 500 million and instead of the job needing another 500 million to finish now they need another 1.2 billion on top of the 500 million that's already spent and nine times out of 10 these finances aren't going to want to do it because they see that the return on investment is no longer there. And that's because of these tariffs. So you're going to see tons of jobs Across the Nation getting shut down which is going to shut down construction jobs and that's going to have a huge impact on how the jobs market and economy looks",2025-08-01T17:57:42Z,6

I started kindergarten in 1978. I graduated high school in 1992. We commonly had 30 kids in a class and I more often than not was in a split class in the lower grade. The behavior of students was good for the most part. There was no physical discipline. If you misbehaved you stayed after school, wrote lines, cleaned the class room and parents were notified and the principal was involved. High school class sizes were smaller. Discipline was the same.  What are parents doing now that is so different? Are they less engaged? Are they just letting their kids run wild with no discipline? I don't understand why school is so different now. My kids who went to school in the 2000's had a similar experience to mine. We also didn't have laptops and phones and neither did my kids. Were we just less distracted? I'm trying to understand. It seems really short sighted to gut the department of education. But what can you expect from a man who paid his sister to do his homework and paid someone else to take his college entrance exams etc. This is all common knowledge TRUMP himself has said these things in interviews from past years. What kind of future can we look forward to if we have an entire generation of poorly educated people? What does this mean future generations?

For many long-term unemployed workers, getting laid off shortly after rehiring wipes out whatever stability they’d managed to rebuild, leaving them exactly where they started—as if they'd never taken the job at all.   So then... what’s the point? To endure toxic employers whose wages don’t cover basic living costs—at this stage, you’re basically paying the employer to work for them. That's madness—and yet it's probably many people's reality.   Delaying hiring like many of these companies are doing may protect employers’ short-term profits, but over time it erodes workers' collective morale, shrinking the labor pool, as more people stop seeing traditional employment as a viable path forward.",2025-08-23T22:18:11Z,2

I hope that local governments and school districts can stay afloat. They are all heavily indebted and have financed bond debt with bond debt. The banks offload toxic debt in financial products that governments and school districts buy on the cheap for retirement funds for their employees. It’s really scary.

It just doesn't make sense to put someone through training just so they can quit two weeks later.  Also, employees who think that they are better than the position they're in tend to have a bad attitude and not really be committed to quality work.  If she would have just went to the interview and had an attitude of wanting the job as a longer term committment, they probably would have hired her.

The industry is oversaturated with mediocre people who think having a TikTok account = marketing. Content creators are the ones getting replaced by AI. People who want a job in this industry need to sharpen their tech and strategy skills. Marketing doesn't equal social media. That's a teeny tiny slice of the pie. It's also simply a single tactic in one channel among many. The real money is knowing how to create strategies that move the needle ($$$) and how to use tech to enhance your results. You know, the real work behind the scenes.   What you're talking about paying content creators is promotion. Again, just a small slice of what ""marketing"" is in the real world. The money in marketing typically isn't in the ""fun, sexy"" promo nonsense people think of when they think of marketing. Companies still have heads of marketing that make those decisions. They're just shifting budgeted media dollars from traditional buys to content creators.",2025-11-13T22:38:18Z,5

I found a part time job making around $8.00 working 20 hours a week. I could not find a full time. They laid me off years later and I eventually ended up a state job.

It makes me not feel so crazy. I literally have applied to 100s of jobs and got rejected or not even gotten a response back. It's absolutely wild. 10 years ago i had offers flying at me from every which direction and the last 4 months its been crickets.  Recruiters i have known for 15+ yrs are confirming the same thing with me. They told me, ""theres just nothing out there right now and im sorry you lost your job and if i find anything ill send it your way."" Then,  i hear nothing.  I too have just given up on the job search.  I gave 20 yrs to my profession. I'm awesome at what i do and have always been a top performer.  But none of it matters in todays economy.  And, you are right, these jobs suck the life out of us. My heart is heavy for those in their 20s and 30s, knowing what i know now, i know the corporate world will suck every thing out of you and then just dump you on the side. So sad indeed.",2025-05-01T16:32:26Z,3

If enough people cut their job applications by 75%, employers will start to feel the drop in demand. Suddenly, their ""we’ll get back to you"" mindset flips to ""why isn’t anyone applying?""  Of the 25% of roles you do go after, be selective—like you're the one with options. Because you are. For half, list your actual target salary. For the other half, triple it. Not because you're greedy—but because you're helping set a new norm. When companies see fewer applicants and higher wage expectations, they’re forced to act faster and start valuing talent more realistically.  And here’s the kicker: this shift is only fair. With AI, the average worker now produces 2–3x more than before. So why should you settle for less?  You can all race to the bottom—or you can move in sync and make the market adjust to you. The power’s not in one application. It’s in all of ours, together.",2025-04-30T16:02:00Z,2

Just because they aren’t actively complaining on TikTok (they don't have the time) doesn’t mean they aren’t suffering - they are!, and they have been for decades. This crisis is not new.  For example, older American technology workers - forced into chronic unemployment or underemployment due to cheap labor and outsourcing since the early 90s - are now reaching retirement age with insufficient savings and inadequate Social Security contributions (due to being chronically locked out, not financial irresponsibility). The financial devastation they’ve faced over decades has left them without a path to retirement, facing the grim reality of total financial insecurity. They're not young; and they do not have the luxury of time (time horizon) to wait for any ""market correction."" Their livelihoods were ripped away.  These are people who adapted, who educated and even re-educated themselves as technology endlessly evolved - who paid their debts and fulfilled their obligations - only to find themselves abandoned in old age. Their plight should not be ignored. They deserve advocacy, and even be the centerpiece of your videos because theirs is a dire situation now.",2025-05-10T00:56:13Z,2

So there is now a glut on the market. This is driving down prices as well. Simple supply and demand, Economics 101.  Problem is, you now have a hole in the economy that you cannot fill (something like 10-30% of your tourist dollars), which means that people in the service sector will be laid off, which means more people being forced to sell, and this leads to more houses on the market with no buyers.

Our society normalized those behaviors and during the prosperous years most people who borrowed for homes were able to pull it off and in most cases enjoy their equity increasing, property values increasing also. Jobs have not really been that secure as a rule, since manufacturing went to China. The old school cash and carry people who saved and lived moderately without the credit cards and other easy credit options, seem to me to be in a much better position all around , to survive todays dire  situation. If you own your house outright , have no debt, in a cash and carry position, you can possible live on social security, depending where you live, I personally knew years ago i would not be able to retire in the U.S., not even a poor southern state so i bought property in the West Indies and built an ocean front home. I have no debt, no property taxes or insurance, I pay 25 dollars a year for car inns.

I said it before here, it’s a clean up of the useless DEI corporations and business and government had to carry under the liberal narrative…..under a matriarchal narrative.  That’s over and this is the result.  Everybody outside of that  DEI “class” (females, minorities, LGBT’s, H1B, millennial and Gen zero Kamala voters, etc etc) are doing just fine.   Until you start reinforcing the real reason this is happening your speculation and analysis is skewed. You start being more real and honest and maybe I’ll subscribe.   This is going to be a transitional phase and very good for the country. As Trump has alluded to we’ll be entering an America where common sense and more importantly “merit” will rule the day, not DEI.

Really liking this channel the more I tune in. 🎉  Correct, 75% of ppl are living way beyond their means and one slight hiccup, the walls crumble and tumble down. Could be a job loss, medical issue, spouse sudden passing, accident. Anything is possible, and one needs to be smart and think about the what ifs vs. putting your head in the sand and hope nothing happens. It will. Tonight, an unexpected battery goes. V6 battery and a new decent one is $250.  Just like that, so you need to be super careful so you can handle anything that pops unexpectedly. Regarding the woman, I imagine her rent, debts, car, etc. did her in and rather quickly. Making $200k, she ""should"" have been able to sustain things longer than 6 mths. Plus, she got a severance and unemployment.  It's tough, so I hope she can get out of it ok and move in with parents or something 😕 🙏 ❤",2025-06-25T23:12:58Z,2

They've had to close up because they've lost major county accounts I guess, at least here in Hernando county. The counties were drawing up contracts for new waste disposal and Republic came up a little bit more money than the other service that put their bid in, so that's probably why they've had to close that down.  The economy here is interesting to say the least. If you're coming from another state and you're used to getting paid more money, you will get paid a lot less here but you'll be paying more for housing and rent. The governor just announced today that they are going to put a referendum on November 2026 ballot. He's trying to do away with property taxes. Florida would be the first state to not have any property tax. In a good economy, this would probably would work for us, but it's a little early to say that they will be able to get money from other places to cover services.  I think if they can make it work it will cause a major housing boom down here. There are houses being built and apartment buildings being built right and left, but nobody's moving into them yet. Our housing market is teetering as homeowners insurance is so incredibly expensive in some areas. And for everyone that's noticed that our hurricane season has been slow, (we don't use the Q word) that is absolutely not normal! Lucky, but not normal! So please don't think that you can come to Florida and escape hurricanes, because it's kind of our thing and it's what we do.😊 Good luck out there.",2025-10-23T19:44:36Z,0

Basically you have to know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody that knows a friend of somebody that might be able to get you an interview doesn’t mean you’re gonna get hired. Florida has too many ghost positions companies saying they’re hiring people putting in hundreds of applications nobody’s being hired. It’s all ghost positions and if new people are coming down here make sure you have enough money to last you for at least six months before you get your first job a lot of these companies down here will not hire people right off the batt when they move in is due to they don’t know if they’re gonna stay or not because we get a lot of transient here that come in for a short time and leave. And also the so-called property taxes, the car insurance taxes. The healthcare grocery prices are high might be higher than some other states, but they’re high here due to Florida is a low wage paying state, even though they put the minimum wage is capped at 15 an hour next year and the cost of rent and mortgage nobody can afford it.",2025-10-23T13:23:11Z,1

We have experienced several rounds of layoffs since the COVID-19 pandemic. In my department, over 90% of work is now done by AI. We have seen this coming. You adapt and learn new skills, or you are gone. We laíd off thousands of Employees globally. There is nothing in ruins (at this moment, I do not say it is not coming). Driving people crazy is not helping either. For the individual, it isn't very pleasant, but for the companies, it is often needed for survival. It is not always only about profit. My girlfriend has been searching for months already for a job too. It is a hard market right now, but you have to be flexible. The lady in the video ""40% layoffs"" of what? 10 people company, 100 000 people company? That makes a big difference.
