If you put a nail on the line, it is counted as too low or too high. It must be in between both of the lines. If he's laying shingles like this, they're all f*****, and that's the truth.

I drove Cents Per Mile, owner operator and lease operator. OTR.   It not very profitable.   -owner operator. If you buy a brand new truck, your expenses go towards the truck payment, trailer payment (which is another expense), insurance for both truck and trailer, insurance for the loads, fuel for both truck and trailer, IFTA,  Tolls (east coast tolls are absurdly expensive) . Plus,  repair schedules. Also, depends highly on what the market offers and other factors. Sure, you can earn 350k - 450k gross per year. BUT, with all of those expenses  you will net under 60k per year. And then you're taxed on personal income.  If you buy USED equipment, the same as above applies, except now there are major pending issues, repairs, and preventive  maintenance. Your equipment will become a risk factor. -Cpm (cent per mile) you can earn 50-75 cents per mile, but most  if not all, companies have you running from zipcode to zipcode basis instead of per mile. You have no control on maintenance and no control on basically anything. And then escrow gets removed, also, personal tax at 33%.  -lease operator is almost a hybrid of both owner and CPM, just depending of the clauses being signed for at the beginning of your contract agreements.  The only and best way to make good money is if you own a company and have everyone else work for you,  take no executive decisions with 200+ trucks, have your own shop, have your own insurance firm and have PRISTINE, loyal and fully dedicated drivers under your belt.

Most states have a program through the EDD to get your CLASS A CDL for free. A lot of companies will also offer to reimburse or pay for your truck school. Now that we got that out the way.  I was running local and making 100k a year cause I found a nice gig after 2 years of experience. Still with that company but now a floater (thinking about traveling nurse but as a truck driver for other local yards) and expecting to make 140k this year. I work 4 weeks and 1 week home, the one week home I still get paid. Sometimes you just gotta keep looking at the job listings other times you have to know somebody to get you in. For most local jobs though I would say expect to make around 60-80k and if hauling hazmat maybe up to 100k or decently more depending on area. Still better than a lot and more than enough to live on depending on your area.  You could also work for a mega carrier (Big Fleet companies like Swift, CR England, knight, etc.) and eventually become a trainer. I’ve heard lots of numbers for this but never personally done it so can’t vouch but have heard they can make anywhere from 120-180k a year depending how many trainees they want.",2025-05-23T20:44:49Z,10

A job has value not only on the money you can potentialy earn, but also on the ""extra skill/value"" that you earn when you learn them, that are useful for your personal life. A good example of this are Plumber and Electrician (both mentioned on this video). But Account is pretty important because not only allows you to work in a company, it also teach you how business are run: how taxes work, how money works, how interest, and economics work. Now, all of a suden, you are able to administrate (in a more efficient way) your own business. You probably was able to make this list, because of your knowledge about finalcial and economics terms... the ones you learn by studying accounting..

Sold the truck about a year ago and now I’m ready to get out of the trucking business altogether. Like he mentioned it’s a lot of time away from home and as I get older and become more family oriented I want to be home a reasonable amount of time. Also, I have other business goals that’s hard to accomplish when you’re stuck in a truck away from home a couple of days at a time. Already started my journey into real estate as a wholesaler and soon to be investor, and I’m planning on changing careers to become an electrician. Currently studying for the apprenticeship, aptitude test. And also down the line I plan on becoming a Gun Smith as well.",2025-05-23T18:08:16Z,6

So I’m 23 years old now but my first job was as a tractor mechanic and a ranch hand for a cattle rancher. I was 12 years old and that was my first time turning a wrench for a paycheck. Before that I just did some tinkering on my own stuff. From then to now I’ve done quite a few things. I never stopped being a mechanic, but it did turn into a weekend thing along the way but now it’s full time. The list of things I’ve done are auto body repair and painting, auto mechanic, heavy equipment mechanic, residential electrician, residential plumbing, pipeline labor hand, pipeline welder, and emergency environmental hazmat clean up(oil spills, fuel spills, chemical spills, etc.). I’m probably forgetting one or two things, or maybe not. I didn’t do a bunch of jobs because I couldn’t hold one down, I did them all so I could get the experience, learn what I’d love the most, and learn what I want to do. So I went back to being an auto mechanic. BUT I have my own little shop. I’m my own boss. I wouldn’t recommend becoming a mechanic and working at a dealership or a cheap crappy shop. It’s already a hard trade and those places will only make it 10x harder and it’ll not be worth it at all. If I wanted to change things up and become an employee, I would go back to being a heavy equipment mechanic but for a company that needs a mechanic for their own fleet. Which is what I did before. If not that then I’d really like to get into being a lineman. Now if I still wanted to be my own boss but not be a mechanic anymore, I’d start my own little welding shop for repairs or even fabrications. Or I’d create a mobile welding business to go around repairing stuff for people/businesses such as gates, handrails, fences, staircases, etc.  Which he also discussed in this video. With all of that being said, I hope this helps someone finally decide what they might wanna do next.",2025-03-06T04:33:14Z,22

You can also get certified to inspect welds.  Lol, most welders I have met want to get into NDT.   Smart kids who can do a little math can work up to 6 figures in around 5 years.

Anyway, I'm outside installing the boxes for the exterior lighting, and across the street, I noticed a strip of townhouses getting a new roof put on. Just before lunch, I see this inmate getting released, and I'm in earshot of this building. The guard lets him out and says, ""All right buddy, have a good one, I'll see you next time"" (which is comical in itself). This guy then proceeds to walk across the parking lot, crosses the street, climbs the ladder on these townhouses, and gets right to work.

Those two distinctions would be 1) new construction vs. remodel/service work 2) commercial vs. residential.  A residential service plumber is a very different career than a commercial new construction plumber/pipe fitter.  The first involves backed up drains, leaky faucets, bath remodels, etc. which is a great job, but it is not the same experience that a new construction plumber working on new hospital or data center will have.  This would equally apply to most other building trades.  I think the generalization of trades across these factors also waters down the salary information.  With that said, having spent nearly 40 years in commercial construction, I would recommend anyone looking for a new career who is interested in ""making things"" and seeing the result of their work daily look at commercial building trades.  Electrician, plumber, sheet metal, carpentry (finish & rough), pipe fitter, fire sprinkler, fire alarm/low voltage, flooring, tile, terrazzo, waterproofing, metal studs/drywall, concrete, elevators, masonry, etc.  They all have something to offer and the diversity in work and conditions should allow you to fit into one you enjoy.  Also, most skills learned in any of these trades can apply to any of the other so if you don't like the first one you try, find other to experience.",2025-03-06T12:45:28Z,23

He left early because his career was taking off! In the years after graduating, I bounced around a bunch of dead end jobs. But I learned a trade that is never mentioned anywhere, but has made me a great life. I have my own one-man garage door repair business(full time) basically serving one county in the northwest metro Atlanta. This county is where the Atlanta Braves have their stadium. But there are about 315,000 houses, most of which have garage doors. And there are very few of us door techs around. So I stay busy 6 days per week, work in the field about 5 hours per day, home for lunch every day, pick my own hours, and still average $75,000 per year! I chose not to install whole doors, so this saves body wear and tear(I’m 48). For guys like me who also install doors, it is not unheard of to make over $100,000 per year! The key is picking a very populated area, an in demand trade, and a ton of wealthy citizens.",2025-04-03T20:26:45Z,61

These include the overall phenomenon called ""structural unemployment.""  Some economists have predicted this for decades because of its Malthusian essence.  Too many people, not enough jobs.  It will never return to what was.  It's not part of normal economic cycles that the experts are so fond of citing. It's exacerbated by AI and robotics.  Unless the government was proactive in planning to make society more socialistic, and improving conditions for citizens, then it's a down hill slide towards a plutocracy. Unfortunately that's the widening chasm between the rich and the poor, leaving the mid-class in tatters trying to maintain their standard of living in a country where the average person is involved in a non-consensual relationship with an economy hell bent on fleecing the shit out of people.  The automobile is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on a populace. Just add up all the costs inherent in the operation of your car and hang up and drive.  The fender bender industry wants you on your phone, with headlights unique to each model and absurd prices for injection molded parts with insane margins. Back to the acyclic economic milieu in which we exist.  The end of the petroleum age means that we are seeing prices rise based on a truer calculation of embedded costs.   The slow death of urban core retail means that commercial real estate is getting shitty, and that sector has anchored funds and such for years.   Bankers are slow to adjust. Every company is squeezing everything for revenue, meaning the firings and the terrible job market are the tip of the iceberg. The guy who got voted in isn't doing anything to help you folks that believed the rhetoric.  He just wants to aggrandize himself and his cronies by reviving the polluting of our country while bad mouthing renewable energy because of its effect on the ""landscape.""   Since when has he given a shit about the natural world? Has he visited an open pit mine recently.  He has doubled his net worth over the last 6-18 months, while most US citizens are suffering.   Make no mistake: He doesn't give a shit about any of us, unless you're part of the war machine dominated by the Big 5 and go to Davos or Tetons.   Over Easter he dismissed us all and said ""just enjoy your life"" in a display of such callous indifference the average person's plight as to be obscene. He has begun to take away the basic right to free speech and his attacks on people smarter than he is who criticize what is happening is truly frightening.  We should all be very concerned and petition our generally greedy representatives who are often focused on their own inside information making their assisted stock market picks way easier. Stop attacking people who you might call liberal and understand that it will require all of us to find accord and quorum to achieve any progress.   Infighting and factionalism will be our downfall.",2025-09-08T00:43:25Z,11

I started kindergarten in 1978. I graduated high school in 1992. We commonly had 30 kids in a class and I more often than not was in a split class in the lower grade. The behavior of students was good for the most part. There was no physical discipline. If you misbehaved you stayed after school, wrote lines, cleaned the class room and parents were notified and the principal was involved. High school class sizes were smaller. Discipline was the same.  What are parents doing now that is so different? Are they less engaged? Are they just letting their kids run wild with no discipline? I don't understand why school is so different now. My kids who went to school in the 2000's had a similar experience to mine. We also didn't have laptops and phones and neither did my kids. Were we just less distracted? I'm trying to understand. It seems really short sighted to gut the department of education. But what can you expect from a man who paid his sister to do his homework and paid someone else to take his college entrance exams etc. This is all common knowledge TRUMP himself has said these things in interviews from past years. What kind of future can we look forward to if we have an entire generation of poorly educated people? What does this mean future generations?

So then... what’s the point? To endure toxic employers whose wages don’t cover basic living costs—at this stage, you’re basically paying the employer to work for them. That's madness—and yet it's probably many people's reality.   Delaying hiring like many of these companies are doing may protect employers’ short-term profits, but over time it erodes workers' collective morale, shrinking the labor pool, as more people stop seeing traditional employment as a viable path forward.",2025-08-23T22:18:11Z,2

I was working midnights, 6-7 days a week in a local aerospace bearings manufacturing company and going to school full time. On a good day I was able to get about 2.5 hours of sleep, that was without eating at home with my children or cooking them dinner. I had to get to bed as soon as I could. I wasn’t able to spend much time with my kids after we all got home from school. They were older and able to cook for themselves, thank goodness. But still, I wasn’t able to cook for my kids or sit down and relax, spend real time with them, enjoy dinner, and just be a family.   More often than not, I was barely able to get any restful, meaningful sleep. I would literally fall asleep while running the machines & computers in my lab. I actually fell asleep and started dreaming while washing my hands in the restroom on break one night. My lab partner literally had to keep waking me up all the time, I’m sure I would have lost my job if it wasn’t for her. I looked, walked and talked as though I was intoxicated because I was so sleep deprived. I was only in school for a 6 month program!!!   I was 39. They expect 14 year olds to be able to handle that!?! No, they don’t. Their plan is for poor families, like mine, who desperately need money and have no choice but to do this. Especially single-parent families that don’t receive any child support. Wage slaves who live paycheck to paycheck. The families who don’t know how they’re going to pay rent AND utilities PLUS buy groceries. The ones who worry about losing their homes because they’re a month behind on rent and they can’t catch up. The kids will work because they know what’s going on and they don’t want to be homeless either. They won’t be able to handle it and they’ll fall behind in school or maybe they’ll drop out. So the government gets a whole new generation of people who are uneducated. Don Taco told the ENTIRE WORLD that he LOVES the uneducated. So this doesn’t seem like a coincidence to me. Does it to you???  Welcome to the United States of Russia.",2025-08-17T07:58:06Z,34

But they are slow and most of them don’t know the jobs they are getting into and you starting to see a lot of new Karens.

The industry is oversaturated with mediocre people who think having a TikTok account = marketing. Content creators are the ones getting replaced by AI. People who want a job in this industry need to sharpen their tech and strategy skills. Marketing doesn't equal social media. That's a teeny tiny slice of the pie. It's also simply a single tactic in one channel among many. The real money is knowing how to create strategies that move the needle ($$$) and how to use tech to enhance your results. You know, the real work behind the scenes.   What you're talking about paying content creators is promotion. Again, just a small slice of what ""marketing"" is in the real world. The money in marketing typically isn't in the ""fun, sexy"" promo nonsense people think of when they think of marketing. Companies still have heads of marketing that make those decisions. They're just shifting budgeted media dollars from traditional buys to content creators.",2025-11-13T22:38:18Z,5

Y'all called for him to be fired before he was even announced and called him things like Napier 2.0 (don't even get me started on that one). I said I'll wait and see how the presser goes, who he hires, and how recruiting goes. Guess what? It went as well as it could have gone. He nailed the intro presser. He hired the best possible coordinators any team could hire. Now he's recruiting like crazy and has kept the class together. So let's see what else happens before we make another snap judgement. I'm still waiting to see how media days and the camps go but I am excited about all the good news.  Will Gators fans learn from this?

The economy here is interesting to say the least. If you're coming from another state and you're used to getting paid more money, you will get paid a lot less here but you'll be paying more for housing and rent. The governor just announced today that they are going to put a referendum on November 2026 ballot. He's trying to do away with property taxes. Florida would be the first state to not have any property tax. In a good economy, this would probably would work for us, but it's a little early to say that they will be able to get money from other places to cover services.  I think if they can make it work it will cause a major housing boom down here. There are houses being built and apartment buildings being built right and left, but nobody's moving into them yet. Our housing market is teetering as homeowners insurance is so incredibly expensive in some areas. And for everyone that's noticed that our hurricane season has been slow, (we don't use the Q word) that is absolutely not normal! Lucky, but not normal! So please don't think that you can come to Florida and escape hurricanes, because it's kind of our thing and it's what we do.😊 Good luck out there.",2025-10-23T19:44:36Z,0

Basically you have to know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody that knows a friend of somebody that might be able to get you an interview doesn’t mean you’re gonna get hired. Florida has too many ghost positions companies saying they’re hiring people putting in hundreds of applications nobody’s being hired. It’s all ghost positions and if new people are coming down here make sure you have enough money to last you for at least six months before you get your first job a lot of these companies down here will not hire people right off the batt when they move in is due to they don’t know if they’re gonna stay or not because we get a lot of transient here that come in for a short time and leave. And also the so-called property taxes, the car insurance taxes. The healthcare grocery prices are high might be higher than some other states, but they’re high here due to Florida is a low wage paying state, even though they put the minimum wage is capped at 15 an hour next year and the cost of rent and mortgage nobody can afford it.",2025-10-23T13:23:11Z,1

He is grossly out-of-place in that ultra-liberal, far left ""woke"" environment compared to SEC country (more conservative).  Jedd was trained by Spurrier at his Alma Mater, Florida.  Here in AZ, he did the unthinkable by turning the Wildcats into an SEC caliber of team two years ago. I was at Tempe when U of A routed ASU.  But U of A had administration problems and Fisch left for Washington.  But he could leave again as I understand he and his family are not happy in Seattle.  Honestly, as a Gator I would prefer Jedd over Lane.  I think Kiffin should stay at Ole Miss.  Jedd could be hired with a bargain and probably be just as good in bringing the Gators back.  I saw his work here in Arizona.   As for SEC football, that Ole Miss-Florida game at Gainesville ten years ago was the most intense I had ever seen from a home crowd.  I was an undergraduate at Notre Dame and attended the last championship game for ND in 1989 at the Fiesta Bowl.

He's been at Tennessee, USC, FAU and Ole Miss. In those 14 years, his teams have only finished the season ranked in the Top 25 on 4 occasions. This year will make 5.  In his 11 years at the Power-4 level as a HC, he has never won a Natty or made it to a National Title game. He has never won a Conference Title or even made it to a Conference Title game. He won't this year either.  I've never in my life seen fans and now AD's and school president's go completely goofy over someone who hasn't won anything as a HC at a P-4 program. His biggest win ever is against Georgia in 2024. It was just a regular season game. Everybody hated his ass for 2 decades and now Florida and LSU are supposedly offering $15 million per year to land him. 😂 He literally has one 11 win season coming into this year.   Most coaches that get courted by other schools like Kiffin has, those coaches have an entire wing of their house dedicated just to all their trophies. Yet here is Lane Kiffin and his trophies could all fit in a medicine cabinet with room to spare. Well, maybe he could fill a broom closet. 😂",2025-11-20T23:10:40Z,2

The guy in the other comment hit it right on the head. If he’s happy winning 10 or 11 games a year and falling short every year then Oxford is the place for him. This man was raised by a fierce competitor. He’s no different. He hasn’t said, “I’m staying let’s just stop talking about it!” He hasn’t even signed an extension. Even if it has to go through the state senate or whatever to be approved there’s still nothing in the works you’ve heard anything about! 80+ million $80,000,000 dollars!!!!!!!

Being poor you won't have enough money to buy statins. For once poverty actually helped you. For the vast majority of people statins do no good (life expectancy is the same whether you take statins or not) but they also have harmful side effects. They case diabetes and pregnant women taking them risk having deformed babies. Get the fact by reading 'The Great Cholesterol Con' by Dr Malcolm Kendrick.,2025-10-27T15:46:04Z,1
