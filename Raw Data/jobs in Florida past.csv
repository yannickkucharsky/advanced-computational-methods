Only about 1 month out of the year it gets a little cold, in January. It gets down to about 45 at night, around 65 during the day. But come February it warns back up again.

Florida used to be quite  cheap compared to most metropolitan areas in the country. Over the last  20-30 years, real estate prices in the better coastal cities (and  Orlando) have increased dramatically. My mother bought us, our first  home in a hip area of Ft. Lauderdale, back in 1964, for $11,000. Today,  that same home (renovated) and 2 blocks away from extravagant Las Olas  Blvd. (if you know Ft. Lauderdale) is now worth over $850,000.   I purchased my first home in Sarasota back in 1988. It's was a Florida  Craftsman Bungalow style, and I paid $41,000. Today, that home is worth  about $300,000, but only because it is in a gentrifying area near  downtown Sarasota. Those are extreme examples, but I have seen real  estate prices triple here in Sarasota, for most homes since the 1980's.  As more people relocate to the more sought-after areas of Florida, it  has pushed the prices of real estate to almost un-affordable levels for  the working class folks. In Sarasota, just a basic home will cost $200k  minimum. If you go south to North Port or Port Charlotte, a basic home  will run about $160k and up. A 2 bedroom apartment in Sarasota for rent  is about $1400/month. It might be lower outside the Sarasota city area,  which tends to run about 20% higher than surrounding communities.  Florida has a lot of service-sector jobs, where $12/hour is about  average. So, unless you make a real professional wage, like $25/hour and  up, (and I mean mostly ""up""), then Florida could seem quite expensive.  Probably one of the best industries I can think of to work in Florida,  would be healthcare, with the aging population here. If you are coming   from the major cities of the northeast (N.Y., Boston, Philadelphia),  then prices of homes in Florida will seem reasonable. If you're coming  from ""flyover country"" in the mid-west, or some small town somewhere,  then Florida will seem expensive. If you're coming from a major city in  California, then Florida will seem like an absolute bargain in  comparison.   If you're retired or nearing retirement, and have owned a home up north  that is now worth $800k to over a million dollars, you can sell that  home, move to Florida, and buy a beautiful home in a gated community for  $400,000+ and live the good life with the money left over, and of  course, never have to shovel snow again. Be prepared for population  growth. It is getting crowded down here now!",2019-07-24T14:50:46Z,94

d52jLP8csNw,My EDC as a armed security guard in Florida,,2019-10-19T08:11:01Z,@officialIllustrat3d,"Armed officer here (4 years) my only point outs here are this. Please take the knife off your vest unless you have a holster for it. With zero retention, it's going to be easy for someone to take it from you. Also, I never have a problem with people keeping extra protection, but you're going to find yourself in jail if you're caught using a firearm you didn't qualify with through the company. I'm not saying you didn't qualify with it, but if you didn't then I would look into making that happen asap. Lastly, you have ZERO non lethal items on your carry. If you're in the security or LE industry you NEED to have non lethal and use that as your first resort if at all possible. With only having lethal, that's going to have 2 outcomes, A you're gonna get into a physical altercation to avoid using deadly force to which someone will take your knife or one of your firearms, or B you're gonna not think twice and jump straight to lethal force and end up in trouble. No disrespect at all, I just don't wanna see a brother in arms get popped over small things they can fix 🤙🤙",2022-08-12T15:05:06Z,66

Now, I'm not trying to be an asshole but I feel compelled to tell you the following out of LOVE and as a fellow armed security professional currently working for a high-net worth individual:  1. Fix your collar. Presentation is everything, especially when you put yourself out there in the world. Online or otherwise.   2. Pronounce the brands correctly. It reflects on your ability to comprehend and speak the English language well, which is imperative as a Black American.   3. You do not need to unholster and brandish your firearm just to tell us what the brand is. Props on the trigger finger discipline, though.  4. Please do not pocket-carry a striker-fired firearm with the trigger exposed. If you're going to pocket-carry anything, it should be some with HEAVY double-action trigger pull.  5. Have better posture when you speak. Project your strength onto those who would look upon you. Not to be macho, but to project strength and confidence in yourself.   Again I'm telling you all this out of love, bro. Alot of people will just pat you on the back for being armed and employed. That is not enough.

BTW, immigrant construction quality is atrocious. I used to get $30 to paint--professional quality painting--now it's down to $11-$12 an hour to start. You will not pay rent on $12 an hour. You will need to find a room to rent, but that will cost you $600 a  month. Lots of people in Florida room up, five or six to a house, to be able to afford rent on $12 an hour.   Business is happy with immigrants, because they absolutely lower all wages while keeping the cost of living high. I recommend that you find a state that doesn't have a high amount of cheap, immigrant labor to flood the market.  Florida is not one of those states.",2018-06-20T18:08:11Z,85

Do not work at Home Depot, Lowes, Fedex, Amazon or UPS in Central Florida. It'll be difficult to become ambitious and driven to do anything else. They will have you work 8 hours one week then 40 hours the next, but you'll still be part-time with minimal benefits. You'll work with miserable people who can't retire and don't want to train you because they don't want to lose their job to you. Working in restaurant/catering/hotels might actually allow you to meet wonderful people who give a f*ck about you. Be around people that motivate you. People think Florida is nothing but paradise and it's not. Either work your way into a great field or become wage slave or zombie. It's very easy to get lazy and hooked on drugs in Florida.",2018-07-06T20:14:12Z,41

I lived in NY for 26 yrs. Everybody knows how over crowded it is and the crowd is not exactly pleasant. The winters have been BRUTAL, if you drive you will be miserable. I got married and moved into 2 bedroom apartment paying $1425 per month. The second room was the size of a walk in closet. My wife and I made a combined $75k per yr. before taxes. After taxes we were making $52000. We had car payment, ins, utility bills, food, misc. etc. and were managing to save almost $1k per month. I have an ear condition that got progressively worse and the cold weather made it more acute. Combining my health condition and the STRESS of living in NY, I honestly felt that I was going crazy. My quality of life was ZERO. I decided to move to central Florida and my wife and I got jobs with the dept. of Education. It is not the best but we make a combined $3900 per month after taxes. We are currently renting a 4 bedroom 3 bathroom house with beautiful scenery and peaceful environment for $1250, We still pay car, ins, utilities, food, misc, etc. We manage to save the same about 1k per month. We are already planning on purchasing a home. Would I have been able to consider that in NY? NO.  In order for a married couple to purchase a home, they have to make a combined 150k and the house will not compare with what you can get in florida for just 200k. With that said, the quality of life cannot compare to NY. I feel alive here. In NY? dying slowly. I'm not saying that there are pros and cons and that everything has a catch but that is my honest experience so far.",2018-07-05T00:15:16Z,45

I always hear about the low paying jobs here and the bad traffic (which I dont have to drive in either). I have sales and higher education experience as well. Thankfully, its just me, no kids, no hubby so I dont have the stress of having to take care of a family. The rent and car insurance is the only things that are higher. Everything else is lower compared to Cleveland so for me, it’s a wash. Hopefully if I ever have to find a job here, I’ll look for companies in other states that have offices or remote positions in Florida or I’ll just make sure I’m debt free so if I have to take a pay cut it wont matter. I looove the Florida weather (Palm Harbor/WestCoast) and it is truly paradise here and beautiful. The people are friendly as well.

For those that are worried about cockroaches, I'm guessing Florida has the traditional ones but the ones most common in Florida are the palmetto bugs. I believe it's the moisture they're attracted to & not anything to do with how clean your home is or isn't.  If you're concerned about sink holes,  just Google sink hole activity reports for whatever county you're interested in and you can see the most current data,  it's essentially worthless though because if it's going to happen, it's going to happen.  You can't control mother nature. Sarasota has been impacted by Hurricanes and tropical storms, its literally hit or miss... again,  mother nature. Every area of the country has different things to worry about.  I lived in pinellas county for over 20 years, never impacted by a hurricane (thank God), had a few Invaders (palmetto bugs), mostly after it rained.  Oh the rain,  Florida...I personally don't miss you and your weird random afternoon rain storms! Lol.  All that said,  Lynette I wish you the very best in your new home and community! I can't wait to see how you decorate it. ♡",2018-12-06T11:49:45Z,2

Three-step protection (brakes on, locomotive in neutral, generator field switch off) is used to prevent the train from moving while somebody is working between cars. Three-step was released some time before 2:00 so the train could move. Unless the conductor had to work between the cars again and you didn't show it, three-step would not have been applied again just because the train had stopped beyond the switch.",2022-01-01T11:50:17Z,1

They hate the little guy down here. Been in Florida since the 90’s and nothing has changed. Florida will implode in on itself economically, especially now more than ever, given the amount of people that have moved here over the years, the gentrification of cities and money being invested into real estate. It’s unsustainable for so many reasons and you will see a mass exodus of people leaving for more affordable states, paying better. Then you’ll see a severe economic crash.

We’re holding out until 2021 so can do MK’s 50th anniversary so can try and get more stuff done to our house before then! Discovery Cove, love that place, it’s like a little piece of paradise 🌺 🐬 100% true about wanting to have a job that you love... it’s always hard to be in a place that you don’t like, but harder sometimes when you know you have to pay the mortgage so you just make it work even if it makes you unhappy. But it shouldn’t have to be that way. You’ll find something one day, like most people you’ll just fall into something and end up loving it x",2018-10-29T19:01:01Z,1

Ugh I'm a few days late in viewing this, I've been sick. Yay, Halloween is my absolute favorite, so I'm looking forward to seeing the Halloween video when you post it! 🎃🎃👻👻 Oh how great you'll finally get back to your Florida!  Yeah, I'm with you on direct flights, sometimes the convenience outranks savings.. It's not worth the savings if I'm a frazzled yell machine on account of trying to juggle kids and catch connections and all that jazz.. Mmmmm..Sweet Tomatoes and Cracker Barrel are two of my favorites! 😋 Yes I would love to see how you decorate for Xmas, can't wait! Oh that Xmas logo is adorable! It's so you! Oh I'm sorry the job didn't work out for you, you were so excited for it.  But it's good to get out now rather than wasting years there being miserable.  Sometimes losing something you thought you wanted is a blessing in disguise, it can free you to find opportunities that actually are right for you.  And you are right, why shouldn't you love your job?  I think sometimes people who are miserable in their jobs or lives try to prevent others from finding happiness, maybe it's the old adage Misery loves company, or maybe they truly don't believe it can be done, since they didn't find happiness they think it's reasonable for everyone else to be miserable too.. but don't listen to the naysayers, they are wrong.  You can absolutely find work you love, it may take some time, but it's not impossible.  Plenty of people do it!  Life is a journey, if you're not happy where you are at, that's a sign to keep searching.  We are not meant to just give up and live in the doldrums until we die.  I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that you find a career that matches your passion!",2018-11-04T08:09:12Z,1

A Florida trip- yay for you. February is always a great time to go. As you know we are DVC, and we love the Vero Beach property. I am glad Simon and you will have extended time away together.    Also happy you will do vlogmas. I think it is a great idea to do it like last year and clump a few days together, that way you do not feel pressured to post a vlog daily. I would love to see your Christmas traditions and all the fun things you and your family do at Christmas.   About the job - I had a feeling it was not going well. I am sorry about that. I worried (when you said at the beginning of the job) that you had quotas to meet and had to work at sales shop, that you might not like the environment. I was afraid it could get negative, since it felt more like sales than being a personal travel agent. Claire - do not worry the right thing will come along for you. I have had jobs that were just jobs. I finally found my fit in being a travel agent, working from home and being my own boss (without sales quotas). You will find it. I am glad you feel the weight and stress lifted. I am glad glad you have Simon and your parents to cheer you along and support you. It will come along just you wait and see.   Loved the chatty vlog.

So happy for you and Simon going to Florida 🌴🍊next February.... can't wait for the Vlogs but you have a good idea not to count down until after Christmas 🎄.... I love Christmas as well but I'm a big fan of Halloween 👻🎃 too 😁 I put up lights and decorations on my house every year and then just switch out some of the lights to Christmas colors mid November. Can't wait for the holiday Vlogs 😁👍🏼 .... and I agree that you should love your job.... I have been working as a Kitchen and Bathroom Designer for the same company for over 30 years! I have a beautiful office I designed myself and I get to watch you while I'm working sometimes 😁😁😁 keep your positive attitude.... I know you will find something 🤗❤️best wishes and good luck 🍀,2018-10-29T23:18:02Z,1

Exciting times. Sorry to hear about you not liking the job with virgin I imagine they were very target driven re sales. Never worked for them just a hunch. So good that you have moved on and are happier. I totally get what you mean about finding a job that you love. I believe there is one out there for you. I feel the same way. Just need to work out what it is and find it. Lol. As for the places you want to visit I love the sound of it. I would love to go to Iceland and see the northern lights. I am lucky I live in Scotland and have seen them here dancing about the sky but would love to see them in Iceland I think it would be amazing. I am lucky enough to say I have been to Australia twice. It’s an amazing country with so so much to see!! I would also recommend New Zealand it’s absolutely stunning. But I love your stop over ideas! Lol. I went via Singapore and went to universal studios there but would love to see the other Disney parks. Xxx ps I have a virgin credit card so I can save up miles. It’s such a great idea like you I got the bonus miles for joining and then I use it to do my normal shopping every month! Also pay it off in full so it’s essentially a debit card that earns air miles. Lol. Another tip you can convert your Tesco club point into virgin airmiles so that’s another way to accrue them. I am not far off enough airmiles to get me to Orlando!! plus like you they fly locally (from Glasgow) directly to Orlando mco!,2018-10-29T22:18:48Z,1

Will you be vlogging whilst you’re there? Myself and my hubby recently did discovery cove and I get the same fear as you. I’m scared of fish and water that isn’t clear to see through (the sea). Swimming with dolphins was absolutely amazing and not scary in the slightest. In fact the scariest bit for me was feeding the dolphin the fish 😂 I’d never touch fish before but it was quick and slime free! I was also worried about swimming with the fish and sting rays. In previous years I’ve wimped our but this time I clung onto my hubby, had a quick panic scream when I felt something touch my leg - which turned out to be a women swimming near by 😂 and swam all of the lagoon! I couldn’t of done it without my husband at my side, but it was really cool to see and I was so proud of myself. I tried to do it again later in the day, but panicked. I think because I’d already done it, there was no need to go again and I didn’t settle the same. Either way, I bloody loved it! Even chilling out, drinking cocktails and snacking on Rice Krispie cakes all day was fab!   So excited for vlogmas and seeing how you decorate for Christmas. I think when you move into a new house, wondering where to place your Christmas tree is the most important part!   Congratulations on your new job too! Someone jobs don’t work out and that’s fine. Have a lovely week! Xx",2018-10-30T09:57:28Z,1

I absolutely loved Discovery Cove when we did it but I am a big animal lover so I very much focused on that but I'm sure you would have a lovely day even if you didn't do the animals. Vlogmas will be wonderful, I personally don't see vlogmas as about posting every day, I watch it because it gives you all the Christmas feels so I think running days together is no issue at all and it would be lovely to see your trip to the Lake District and getting the tree and decorating and all the December things! Also on the job front, I totally get it with wanting to do something that makes you happy.

OMG YES haha THE advent calendar of all advent calendars :) I LOVE the Christmas design for your logo! Amazing!   Ah I was wondering lately how the job was, because you were sooooo excited in the beginning and I had this feeling something was not right anymore. I'm so sorry it wasn't what you hoped it would be. It is however very courageous of you to see that for yourself and to take that step out of it. Well done because those kind of situations can bring people down, it can lead to burn outs and depressions...which is funny because I'm at that stage right now but oh well :p I hope I can have that courage someday. I'm just scared I won't find another job :( It's not easy here to find something decent.  I hate when people say that you're not meant to love your job. It only makes it much easier and more fun if you love what you do. You'll only be better at it and more motivated.

Yes, getting a ""good"" job as a self-taught developer is not ""easy"" down here, but I feel like I lot of people who DO NOT live in Florida unfairly judge the state.  Florida is one of the largest states, has a massive percentage of the US population, and there is no state income tax. There may be no recognized ""tech hubs"" here but there are a decent amount of people to connect with by going to the many meetups (for various languages and interests) and interacting with the available startups and tech incubators.  Job wise, I'm currently a full-stack developer that works with Vue/Laravel. My first paid job was doing Wordpress and eventually I got my chance to work with more interesting things. When I was still learning Javascript frameworks I started with React because I thought that was in the most demand but I was surprised as during my job hunting process I talked or had interviews with 3 different places down here before getting hired that use Vue (these are probably companies starting relatively newer projects).",2019-12-15T17:00:19Z,3

iPFDFOryUKk,"At least 920 Florida teachers out of jobs after failing state test, despite &#39;effective&#39; evaluations","At least 920 Florida teachers just received their pink slips and it's not because they can't teach, but because they can't pass a state ...",2018-07-19T15:36:32Z,@fusionchef1,"Being a teacher and that has taken the new version of this test, I can say this about the non-subjective sections of the test (which are all of them other than the essay) there is no problem with the academic material that is being tested. However, the time limits you are under for all sections of this test are completely ridiculous. As result from the time limits, if you are not a speed reader with very fast computational skills you will have a very hard time passing.                            As for the essay section I will say multiple problems exist.                                                       1. those that are hired to score the essays are not qualified and are simply following a formula given to them by their employer ""Pearson"" this formula dictates a score based off writing mechanisms rather than the actual content.  A big one of these would be the number of of transitions used in writing. It seems they are such a high importance that in fact It would most likely be a good idea to interrupt the flow of how the essay reads to include more transitions.                                                                2. Unless you can type over 30 words a minute you will not have enough time to type a passable essay.                                                              3. Considering the subject you will be typing about is completely random (will most likely have nothing to do with teaching or the educational field)and once again time limitations, unless you can type creatively on the fly with proper essay formatting you will not have enough time.  In regards to challenging your test results:                                              1. Don't bother on any of the academic sections (honestly as I said before there is nothing wrong with the questions the test asks as far as I could tell) it is just the limited time issue that is a problem.                                             2. As for the essay section, it can be challenged more successfully as it is subjective. (By their records the chance of successfully challenging is less than 2%)Honestly I failed the essay section 2 times while having passed the others on the first try.  I challenged both times because you are limited in the number of attempts you get to take the test per year.  The first time I challenged my score, I challenged on academic grounds using their own detailed guidelines on how the essay is graded to argue why I should have a better grade. I made more than a good argument and addressed each and every aspect of how the essay was supposedly grade.  The response I received was a cookie cutter letter saying they have decided the score is accurate. No reason given and the long argument I made was not addressed.There was little question after this that challenging a score on academic grounds valid or not was a waste of time.                                                                    3. The second time I took the essay I once again failed it (was not surprised by this as the essay I wrote the first time was better).  As explained above due to the limit on number of times you are allowed to take the test per year I challenged the score again. But this time successfully.  I am not going to give the exact details of how I managed this as it would invite others to use it for dishonest purposes. I will say though the challenge argument I used was based on the program used to give the essay portion of the test.  I pointed out a mechanism in the testing program that was extremely counter intuitive to the typical person and such cause unintended and unknown errors in what was typed by me the writer. I explained why the mechanism was not an excepted or expected occurrence and mentioned that no other word processing program in use whether it be a widely used program or not has such a mechanism.  I cited specific areas in my typed essay that suffered as result of the above mentioned mechanism.  As result of my argument based on the design of the testing program I received a letter about 7 weeks later simply saying that my test had been reviewed and it had been found that it may qualify for adjustment.  It did not say if the adjustment would mean I would now have a passing score which prompted a phone call to the FTCE customer service line.  When I spoke with the women on the phone she confirmed that the score had been changed to a PASS and she also mentioned I was the first person she ever talked to that managed to win a score verification challenge.  So in short if you plan on challenging your test results you will have to write a extremely detailed argument essay that in itself would easily pass if being scored (this time you should have a good idea what you will be typing about beforehand).  Challenging your score based on academics is futile and the only chance you have to succeed is to attack how the test is being given.                                                                                         So as for the question should the test be changed and how.The answer is yes, but the content of the test is just fine.  I also do not believe that the government throwing money at people or paying for test retakes will serve well.                 Change the following:                                  1. The amount of time given on all sections should be increased a good amount.  Really the test should be about if you can answer the questions effectively not a test of speed.                                                    2. If you pay to challenge your test score you should receive and retain detailed report showing why you did not pass especially on subjective sections.  This report should be detailed enough that a person would easily became to understand what they need to work on/learn in order to pass the test the next time.                                                       3.  Especially for the subjective area of the test (essay section) another company that has no conflicts of interests should be used to grade the test.   Honestly it is in the interest of ""Pearson"" for you to fail the test, so having them grade the test especially the sections where they will be grade subjectively is a conflict of interest that should not exist.",2018-07-23T09:07:50Z,7

You’ll find your way.   I’m shocked something hasn’t popped up yet, but fate doesn’t always give reasons for its path.   The only note I’d give is that you might be over qualified for many of these jobs and, while it might seem crazy, you might want to try “playing cool” on some interviews and not trying to wow. I have had a similar experience where I got excited about a perfect job opportunity, thought I nailed the interview and then came to learn that the person doing the hiring was fearful of hiring their replacement. That could possibly be the case for you. You’ve got plenty of qualifications that speak for themselves on a resume. Maybe take an interview and just try to vibe and fit into the culture initially. Who knows if it’ll work or not but it’s something you could try and see how it goes.   I appreciate the grind man, it may not be as easy to do so yourself in the moment, but preparation  and perseverance pay off and you’ve got that in spades.",2019-10-04T05:31:02Z,16

Though I quit by choice, I went through a similar experience for several months after leaving a previous job some years ago. It’s a difficult and uncomfortable process, especially given that you have a family to support, but it definitely helps to remain hopeful and optimistic. I was fortunate enough that my now-fiancé helped me through the mental and financial stress, so keeping that kind of stuff in mind makes things a little easier.   I assume that you’re already aware, but just in case I’m going to strongly suggest that you check out some of the listings online over at Brewbound; it actually appears that there are a few potential opportunities posted in recent days for what may be within your new area.    Also, not sure if it’s a viable option for you, but maybe look into ridesharing/food delivery “gig” jobs as a temporary side choice. I strongly wanted to participate in such when I went through my situation but my then-car didn’t meet requirements. Hey knowledge is free and you never know how somebody could benefit from hearing something.  Hope all goes well for you and your family, and good luck hunting. Looking forward to the next update.

That is just so F'ed up on the company's side! Here you and your wife are with a new born and Bam your world is turned upside down! I have two things for you to consider. I live near Milwaukee Wisconsin and I know that Miller pays north of 21 an hour but I do not know if they are hiring currently. A friend went there and said its mandatory overtime on weekends but there is money to be made. Plus there are a ton of Craft brewery's in Wisconsin that you could pursue while working at Miller. My favorite and one that is growing fast is Eagle park Brewing. Darwin this brewery has to be on the level of Tree House. I have never had Green or Julius but the NE IPA's as well as the Stouts and Sours will give your taste buds a frenzy. Only draw back is the weather, we have a lot of snow and cold. Secondly I would like to send you some dough to help keep you and your family above water. Do you have a go fund me page? If not I can send it directly to you. But how do we connect?",2019-10-04T08:29:24Z,1

Teachers should be the very best. Drama is a completely useless subject and a waste of taxpayer monies. I mean, come on now, she can't even pass a general elementary level math test? How the hell did she get her teaching credentials which would have made her take the same type of general test. So either she devolved since then or the district hired a person not fit for the teaching profession. Stop your complaining, go learn math, take the test, pass it and move on. You aren't entitled to teach drama.....",2018-08-02T19:44:08Z,4

I also agree that some of these subjects are nonsense and need to be abolished and updated with useful subjects relevant to the local and global economy.,2019-01-04T10:01:06Z,0

Where are the teachers who passed? What are their thoughts? I would encourage everyone to do a sample FTCE Math test before casting judgement, whether for or against. I did a sample SAE for another subject and I feel that the test was fair. You definitely have to study a bit and its not going to be 3 x 5 = 15 kind of stuff but then again you're applying to be a ""Teacher"". The modern day Educated Philosophers and Intellectuals of the Greco-Roman era. People have to have some pride in their trade and need to push a little more. The practice FTCE/SAE tests I took were far easier than the tests I took at Uni. At the same time I can sympathize with those who failed and the Study Guides should be included in the fee you pay to take the test. Last point I'd like to make is that many states have requirements or strong preferences for teachers to have a masters or take even harder tests. Having to have a Masters in itself is both a far worse financial and educational barrier than a FTCE exam. Florida is far from being the worse in terms of the entry process for becoming a teacher. Just my thoughts.",2023-06-22T18:46:21Z,0
