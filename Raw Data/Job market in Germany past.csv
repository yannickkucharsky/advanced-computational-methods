Why? Because you can have level X1000 and you will nevertheless dont understand an austrian outside vienna. All other austrians (specially in the west) speak in a dialect and noone will change it only because you're in the company now. That means even if you would get a job, your social live is dead because you understand nothing...  The only chance you have is to speak german fluent for a view years and than (maybe) you'll have a reasonable chance.  @BoundaryLess Ich geb dir echt den Tip, mach den Leuten klar dass sie mit schlechten Deutschkenntnissen in Wien vielleicht noch durchkommen, aber in OÖ, Salzburg oder Tirol bekommen sie zwar vielleicht den Job und verstehen was sie zum arbeiten verstehen müssen, aber halt auch nicht mehr. Um in den Westen zu gehen  und dort auch am sozialen Leben (privat wie beruflich) teilnehmen zu können, müssen sie wirklich fließend Deutsch sprechen, sonst haben sie im Grunde keine Chance...@UC2U2Z6ApDU3t1hY_LMWZaWg",2018-12-11T15:12:47Z,0

I avoided most unnecessary details.  However it depends on the position you are hunting for, if you speak German (very important) what experience you have already and the character of the company you are in. For example AG type of companies that focus on selling working hours as a source, focus a lot on how productive you are and how experienced you are and less in details not directive relative to that. Other positions focus in different things like languages, personality or other skills. In other words don't do a common mistake: make one template and send it to all. Personalise your CV to the position you want. And of course depending your industrial goals, you will always have companies easy to get you but also easy to fire you if you mess up badly in your testing period.",2018-03-26T06:36:49Z,3

For the KMK process you need to have the notarized copy of the diploma, then the notarized copy grades certificate, the simple copy of the high school - gymnasium and so on but for detailed list of documents needed you have to go to KMK Website and find out what is required for your documents from your country.

I would like to know if I apply for a jobs seeker visa and it gets rejected, will that hamper my chances of getting a student visa later. The reason I ask this question is that the Student visa applications are always judged on the fact that the intention of students coming to Germany should only be to study and then return to their home country. So if the visa authorities keep a track of my Job seeker visa refusal, they will understand that the intention of my student visa application is just to find a job in Germany. I understand that I can always stress on the importance of doing a masters in my SOP but even then will it be a risk.",2020-07-31T17:33:03Z,0
