There’s financial drawbacks but here I go. I’m 33  UPDATE: I’m 32 tho 😂. Pursuing my passion has put me in a higher vibe which means I’m in more joy and I’ve attracted better things. Ironically on a lower salary from my usual job that I still have I am debt free and I have a savings account for the first time in my life. (I’m just attracting more abundance of everything good)   I am a writer. I started monetising my writing already and my first play is being produced. Im unstoppable now. Love you all and I believe in your dream as much as I do mine.

What happened to doing work to earn money, in order to do your own hobbies, and be with your kids/family. Capitalism 2.0. The dirty truth is, that these people who claim to be the glue, are completely unnecessary. Best way to lower your overhead, is cut them out, and hire a manager to get the specialized talent to perform cohesively. Not to try to find engineers who know marketing, and marketers who know IT. That’s a recipe for disaster.",2019-06-29T20:31:51Z,9

Anybody with even _basic_ knowledge of these two companies can tell you they became successful through monopolistic practices and outright criminal behaviour.  Microsoft was given a monopoly on software they bought for a pittance. What did they do with this licence to print money (virtually of course, unlike banks which do it literally)? Did they use their windfall to innovate? Nope, they wrote really bad software for decades and stifled competitors through buyouts or outright sabotage.  Goldman Sachs are a notoriously evil nest of criminals in suits who are stealing from anyone they can, including retirement pensions, governments of all sizes, and their own customers.  The information above is not a revelation for anyone but the growing underclass who rely on ""experts"" like this shill to feed them feelgood nonsense while they get screwed ever harder and deeper, year after year. If Mr. Glue took his own advice with his own career (if you can call economics a career), he'd maybe have the balls to tell you the system is rigged to favour the criminal class who divert our labour for their profit.

I'm a guy; so call centers normally want bilingual (Spanish) females below a certain age.  Reason?  So they don't have to pay a decent, living wage.  Don't get me wrong!  There are hundreds of jobs here, but 95% of them are in the retail, hospitality,  food service, customer service, and grocery-store sectors.  About half of those jobs do not offer benefits packages.  It is the employee's responsibility to purchase insurance from The Marketplace.  Most IT positions are given to people from India who come here on work visas.  For as large as the Phoenix metroplex is, I've never experienced so few opportunities for year-round residents.",2018-08-28T22:56:36Z,6

Luckily throughout college we saved up 8 months of living expenses so it won't be stressful if it takes us a while to find something.  I have noticed that in CT if I apply to 50 jobs I would get one call back however in Phoenix I applied to 20 jobs and got 15 call backs. The job market in Phoenix definitely seems much stronger than the job market in CT. Interviewed last week via Skype for a job with an insurance company and will find out if I'm hired next week.,2018-11-18T19:28:28Z,2

The more money someone has the less of it they spend every month. More of it is saved or ""invested"" in the stock market or other such (which is really just shuffling money around between wealthy people). So increasing the income of those at the very bottom of the economic ladder is extremely stimulative in a long-term fashion. They will spend essentially all of that money every month, frequently at other businesses which also employ low wage workers, while taking much of that increase in their wages out of the ""stagnant"" money held by the wealthy. This increases what is called the velocity of the money which is essentially always good for the economy.",2019-11-02T20:51:29Z,48

There are plenty of case studies that cite the minimum wage increase in addition to rent and tax spikes as a major factor. I’ve seen my own neighborhood I grew up in corporatize and conglomeratize, and all of the family businesses die one by one. Again, not saying adjusting the minimum wage with inflation wasn’t necessary for our ability to live with dignity, but we should be aware that it’s contributing to the destruction of once close knit communities around the city in favor of the gentrifying proliferation of multinationals like Starbucks and Chipotle.",2019-11-02T22:45:35Z,3

Employment has gone up because hours have gone down. Many have adopted Walmart’s stupid strategy of limiting hours, and hiring more people. A lot of those employees have a second job. Restaurants close earlier because they cannot absorb the cost of operating at a slower time. The NYC $15 minimum wage doesn’t apply to all businesses. The state(NY) wide minimum wage is has been increasing every year, until it reaches $15. Those restaurant do not have the traffic to support the cost, so they been closing early. There is a lot of things about the economy in NYC that can not be used as example in other places. I am not against raising the minimum wage, but to look at NYC, and say it works there so it should work everywhere is irresponsible. After 2008 when housing prices were going down, they just slowed down in NYC.

When I was a manager of a McDonald's in my teens; the price of a Big Mac was 17 cents (including labor; national average); McDonald's sold those Big Mac's for around $3 each. Meaning for every Big Mac they sold; they could make and sell at least 16 more. Now the cost is maybe 21 cents and they sell it for upwards of $6.50; which means for every one sold; they can make about 30 additional Big Mac's... Nearly doubling their profits; which doesn't go to their employees, but to their share holders.Their greed screws over the customers (especially the poor who often are the ones having to eat there) and their employees. This isn't just McDonald's, I have worked in the P.O.S. industry for nearly 2 decades and we do a lot of cost analysis for all kinds of restaurants and it's pretty much the same across the board.  Sure, there are some exceptions, but for the most part; these restaurants can definitely afford to pay their employees a LIVING WAGE, not just a minimum one.  David, you are wrong. The people who eat at fast food are largely lower-class (economically that is) people; as prices goes up; patronage goes down. This is clear as more and more fast food restaurants are closing their doors nation wide. Mcdonald's use to have a ""Dollar Menu""; people could afford to eat their.

I'm used to it, but my wife isn't and she misses the money we made in AZ. In NY they take away a lot of money in taxes and you get nothing in return.

I was born and raised in Long Island, she was born in Connecticut and we met at school in upstate NY and lived up there for a bit after graduating.  We are really loving it out here!  I know all the videos are opinions and everyone has a different one but we are enjoying life so much more out here. Your videos are primarily discussing the boroughs of NY as I know that is where your from, however when you leave that area, NY in my opinion was an extremely depressed area.  In Syracuse we found very little to do as it was primarily dictated by the snow. The culture north of the city (Manhattan) was quite rednecky as you put it, so in comparison, we feel like were in a young, hip, liberal community out here in Phoenix and its very refreshing. I moved out here and took a job making twice as much and we are anticipating our cost of living only increasing marginally. Water and electricity seems to be on par with our utilities in NY. Completely worth it for us! The shops and restaurants on the end of our blocks alone, not only are they all at least 4 star places but they are walkable! this was unheard of in upstate NY... Plus we saw a D-Backs game for $20 a ticket. Try seeing ANY of the NY teams for under $100 a ticket.... Any way I would agree with you if your comparing Manhattan to Phoenix, ya the transportation may not be as great out here, access to beaches is nice, but most other things are comparable, if not better. Not to mention the city of Phoenix just looks so much cleaner than NY. Manhattan is only a small part of NY. Think bigger brother and you may appreciate this desert oasis a bit more! Cheers!

This may be a stupid question but does Arizona have a “fall season” with leaves changing color etc. we have looked at some developments online that have tons of trees just wondering we are definitely looking in the areas of AZ that do not get the snow. Also any recommendations on hotels to stay in near Surprise area as that is where we will be looking when we eventually get out there. Thanks so much!,2018-09-29T01:20:58Z,0

I’m an OTR trucker sick of ice and snow , would get a local job. What’s a good area for apartments? Saw the Capri on Camelback  apartments on line , looks nice. I’m into mountain biking. Was looking around south mountain park but saw some posts saying that area was sketchy. Any advice would be great. Thanks.",2018-05-29T14:43:31Z,0

I agree Arizona natives stop watching your too sensitive‼️   I would give Arizona a 5! I am from Jersey. I’ve been here a yr and the only great thing about Arizona to me is you can get a lot for your money when it comes to buying a house. You might be in love with your house but what about everything else?  Arizona has NO cultural diversity!! I love all culturals! Mexicans culture is dominant here!!!! There are tons of Mexican restaurants and chain restaurants here. Phoenix looks very trashy and tons of druggies and homeless people in that area. The out skirts of Phoenix like Suprise, Peoria, Litchfield, Goodyear and so forth are very well maintained and nice areas. People do speak to you in the neighborhoods, well in my neighborhood they do but it doesn’t seem very genuine.  I feel when they know your from areas like NY/NJ/PA the east coast they don’t know how to react towards you. What I mean by that is they don’t seem to know how to conversate with you and they get easily offended from people speaking there mind and are not use to people being straight forward. It’s very hard to make friends here because I like people straight forward. The driving here is a nightmare! Everyone wants to drive up your a‼️ I have Jersey plates and I feel like they act as if they have something to prove when they see my plates. Nothing is done in a hurry and I do mean nothing! They are very laid back here. If you want something done right the first time make sure you thoroughly and I do mean thoroughly explain otherwise it want get done correctly. It’s the desert so if you like Green then Phoenix and surrounding areas is not it! Just my thoughts and opinion and experience.",2018-05-30T19:37:10Z,1
