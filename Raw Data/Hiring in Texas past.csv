Double, rotary based out of Illinois but we drilled Illinois Indiana and Kentucky. Anyone who wants to work on a rig, Do NOT be scared. The first 2 months are the hardest but I promise after that your body is used to it. After a year out there the job got super easy and I remember thinking a lot of times “I can’t believe I’m making this much money to do this easy of work. Don’t get me wrong, finish ups are a bitch. But on finish ups I’d always work a 16hour shift on overtime which made it much easier mentally.  Sorry for my run-on sentence and my shitty grammar.

Few things to clarify the biggest differences between the 2.  -Offshore requires significantly more vetting due to coast guard regulations along with maritime laws etc.   -Offshore also is alot more strict on safety. Almost laughable at times. -Land based will generally pay more, because you will be allowed to work more. Offshore is generally around 50% of the year. Same job from offshore to land was a $20k/yr jump for myself. -Offshore housing is free, but cramped and kind of shitty at best.  -Offshore food is 100% free along with snacks and drinks etc.  -Offshore is significantly easier in terms of getting breaks.   I went from contracting on the railroad, getting 0 breaks, 0 lunch, etc to offshore where (atleast my company Seadrill) there was a 15min break every 2 hours and you get lunch.  During the 15min breaks, snacks are brought into break room.  Generally things like quesadillas, pizza, sandwiches.  Then lunch was usually really good. Like surprisingly good.   All in all, I would stick with land if you are looking for money.  Unless you get on Overseas work, land will allow for more overall hours in the year along with potential per-diem.    Anyone looking to just get started QUICKLY, just apply for ""roustabout"" positions on almost any offshore job.  They hire almost anyone that applies.  Easy easy money.  12hr days and you generally only WORK for half. The work is 95% easy. The 5% that is not easy is all in your leg endurance.  Be prepared to walk up and down stairs constantly. Idc how in shape you are, carrying tanks from u-deck to heli-deck will kick your legs after chasing tag lines for a few hours. Otherwise very easy job.",2022-07-20T00:48:12Z,253

San Antonio has had a big problem recruiting..Training officers at the academy graduate and go work in Austin for more money..Lots more money!! Also, when you consider our population; We are at the lowest amount of officers per capita...In addition, due to SAPDs low pay; Officers work dual shifts as private security or traffic control..This can be a highly dangerous situation for the public..Exhausted Officers who do this;  come to work their SAPDs shift, unable to focus, and be clear headed, and professional..Hence, a  very short tempered officer is more likely to use force, intimidation, and make poor choices during their shift...This is very obvious if you analyze their use of FORCE against Blacks and Hispanics, and as described in The Huffington Post article about SAPD's use of force against minorities..It's a Domino affect that eventually causes distrust, dissention, and a weary public that now; Can only try to protect themselves against these kind of Unconstitutional behaviors by SAPD officers from the top down using their cameras and other video recording devices..I would also add that many performance enhancing drugs from testosterone injections to steroids, and perhaps illegal substances in addition to prior shift alcohol in their system ie. A hangover will also affect the professionalism of these officers. I would suggest an immediate random Alcohol residual tests in addition to a FULL drug panel of tests be given before any shift.. Transparency in providing those results and any actions taken by SAPD to find and fix those issues will alleviate the fears many have about SAPD's poor performance record..C'mon Chief!!! Win our trust again..Do you even care??? I know I am correct in this statement! Want to know how? Ask me!",2019-01-18T23:35:46Z,4
