This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

For reference,  I teach industrial automation technologies how to set up, program, maintain and troubleshoot mechanical automation systems.  Setting up robotic assembly lines, building machines that build machines, etc.   I began teaching only a few years ago after many years in industry.   1. I was in the middle of the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Sometimes didn't know if I'd have a job next month because the plant was moving to overseas.  Also had to deal with many problems with parts and quality after those moves - and having to deal with supply chain when companies would decide to move their lines, but not build a product that directly replaced the one they quit making.  The corporate bottom line looked good, but the headaches from the people left was horrible, and worse, the devastation of the middle class was and is a reality.   2. The middle class is what made the US economy so strong, and it's a hollowed out shell.   Used to be, pretty much any job that wasn't flipping burgers was paying much more than minimum wage, and we didn't expect people to  go their entire lives on that pay.  It was for the kids in high school working part time or someone just out of school who was getting the entry level job that, in a month, or 3 or 6 was making much more than that.  Seriously, 20 years ago, minimum wage full time was less than 1% of the working population.   Actual middle class jobs were 75% of jobs (or more) and paid 10x that amount - AND you could afford to buy a car every couple of years, buy a house, and not have to go into future wage debt with credit cards.   Nowadays, people are trying to keep up appearances, but the US middle class is BROKE.    3. Companies have largely forgotten how to be loyal to employees. Used to be, you could get a job at age 20 or 25 and realistically could work there until retirement. And GROW, not just do the same job for 40 years.  The coming of the ""gig economy"" and the teaching by business schools of ""interchangeable economic units"" from a  Human Resources department had done a lot of the damage here.  Used to be, most middle and large sized companies had a significant training program in place where they would teach employees not only how to do their job, but also give them paths of advancement.   The disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street has choked that out.  For a long time,  you get hired for a job, and if you want a raise or a position advancement, you move somewhere else, instead of growing inside the company.    That seems to be changing a little... but not much. 4. These large tech corporations have done a marvelous job of publicly spreading risk while privately holding wealth - LLMs especially have been ripping off a lot of people from copyright, that, if it had been the other way, would have had the people getting sued - but the government has let the software companies get away with this ""for the greater good"" - even though it's pretty clear that LLMs are going to hurt a lot of people by not giving them a way into being productive. 5. Another dangerous thing about LLM - if it takes away the entry level ""easy"" tasks that are the training/honing tools for people to get good at, say, spotting cancers or other medical things - what happens in 10 or 20 years when all the current experts all die off? Who fills their shoes? If no one is allowed to get better because the job doesn't exist any more - then when there comes a time for the people to be there - where are they coming from?     Honestly, my field is the one area in manufacturing that still his hiring a lot of people - and we've kind of gone through that #5 part already - for many years the maintenance people didn't hire anyone because ""well, we've got Bob, and Bob knows everything"" - until Bob retires, or worse, drops dead from a heart attack...  now no one knows how to maintain the machines.  Smart companies have started waking up to that, and I keep praying the rest of industry does as well - but we've let too much money wreck the safeguards of government - and too many are focused on next quarter instead of next year or 5 years...   Meanwhile, I'm going to train as many people as I can, because when the robots do rise up, the people best able to defeat them are the ones who know how they work.",2025-09-06T14:59:40Z,173

The assumption that we can just retrain everybody runs into serious problems every time I've seen it tested. (1) Many people in their 40's and 50's like what they were trained to do and are reasonably good at it. It isn't easy to tell someone who loves, let's say, working with animals, and tell them ""Sorry, now you have to become an architect."" (2) Many people, after 10-20 years of work experience, become pretty good at doing the EXACT JOB THEY ALREADY HAVE but would be pretty useless if asked to do anything else, even jobs that, on paper, look like the same job. (3) For the most part, people already have the most mentally / intellectually demanding job they can perform. Do not assume you can take a reasonably smart supply chain analyst who hasn't been to school in 15+ years and tell them ""We'll train you to teach English in Japan, since AI can't do that yet."" (4) Pretty soon, AI will be teaching English in Japan, so then what do you tell your ex-supply chain analyst ex-foreign English teacher to do then?

Honestly its difficult to even read all of them.  My advice to you guys is always have a seperate mission statement and always write a follow up email or shows up to the place and ask for any updates once. This puts you on top of the other 99% of applicants who just apply and doesn't do anything else. We grant an interview 100% of the time if you just do these two things because there are hundreds of applicants and we appreciate if the individual hussle just a little more than the rest.,2025-08-31T14:04:05Z,51

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment.

But if you’re looking for a better quality of life, this country has a lot to offer. Here in Sweden, I don’t have to stress about traffic before leaving home. My child gets freshly prepared meals at school, no need to pack lunch every day. When she’s sick, I don’t have to worry about taking time off work. Sweden has a system called VAB (Vård av barn), which allows parents to take up to 120 days off per year to care for a sick child, with financial support from the government.  When our daughter was born, my husband and I were able to take a full year off to be with her, we get generous parental leaves. Clean water, fresh air, safe parks, and high-quality food in supermarkets to name few, Work culture is another important aspect.

You may need to move or won’t get paid as much in your new job. The top 1% of workers will get paid more but everyone else will fall off the map. Like at Meta right now for AI talent. If you’re needed you’ll be paid handsomely. If you’re replaceable then good luck,2025-07-31T14:00:31Z,3

Unfortunately, if it is not yet implemented at this least expensive point in time, then it’s very unlikely to appear at a much more expensive point in time.

Firstly, in many cases (but not always and there are many nuances) there is a toxic work culture whereby young people are ""forced"" to accept unfair conditions because otherwise the employers may argue that ""young people just think about partying and aren't willing to make any sacrifices"" (this is quite a common narrative here). Secondly, because Italy's population is quite old (and other factors), young people often find a stagnant environment, both economically and socially, shall I say, which can be suffocating. There are many things which could be said, but please look at the graph in 3:12. The regions of Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy receive many internal immgitants, because of the prestige of the oldest university in Europe and the financial capital of Italy respectively, which contribute to a more dynamic environment. On the other hand, (mainly) southern regions, which already have many issues to begin with and therefore a monotonous environment, see a large proportion of their young people leaving for other regions or other countries",2025-06-14T10:10:30Z,1221

The idea that because you spent hours on a task it means that you worked a lot misses the point that while you compelted that one task a young worker probably completed another 2/3. And that opens the real problem: the old guard almost never renovated itself and still follows a line of work that it's stuck in the 80s, maybe 90s at best. The young, iper specialized workforce is a menace to the status quo, and because Italy is a country of old people the politicians will always protect them and never actually reform the labour market",2025-06-15T20:13:27Z,41

Each generation funds the pensions of the current retirees, but workers are now outnumbered by pensioners. This makes the system unsustainable and likely to collapse within a couple of decades, leaving today’s young workers without a pension.

One thing I add, though, is the political indifference towardsthe situation: as the majority of the population is old, many politicians prefer to think in the short-term and propose policies that are in favour of the old generations. Many young generations feel that the country is run by old people, stuck in the old times and there is no place for whoever wants to build a future. Also, having worked a little bit in Italy, I can testify that the working conditions are awful and many employees take advantage of young people's naiveness or their desperate need of money and make them sign contracts that aren't really legal (in some places, they don't even give you a contract!).

But even here, in what should be one of the most structured and respected sectors, the system is broken.  I graduated high school with 100/100, but still struggled to find meaningful work. My first job? Stocking shelves in an Amazon warehouse, because I had no experience, and few companies are willing to take a chance on someone fresh out of school. Eventually I made it into my field. And yes, I agree that aviation must have strict exams and standards, people’s lives are at stake. But even within major national institutions like ENAV, which manages all of Italy’s airspace, there are practices that, in my honest opinion, are just scummy.  Legally, you can only be employed on fixed-term contracts for 24 months total for the same role and employer. After that, the company must either justify the extension with a valid cause or convert it to a permanent (indefinite) contract. You’re only allowed four renewals, and there must be mandatory breaks between rehirings (10–20 days depending on contract length).  So what do companies do?  -they hire people for short stints (3 to 6 months) to avoid going over those thresholds; -they avoid calling it a renewal, even when you’re doing the exact same job, to bypass the limit on renewals; -they warn you upfront: ""You can work here for a maximum of 2 or 3 years, then you're out.""; -they require you to resubmit documents like ID, bank info, and criminal records each time, treating you like a new hire, even when you're returning after just a few weeks.  Yes, some of this is tied to compliance with security regulations or bureaucratic HR policies. But let’s be real: a lot of it is by design. The system is built to stay legal, tick the boxes for safety or anti-fraud, but still make it as easy as possible to avoid giving workers indefinite contracts (with all the protections, severance, and obligations that come with them).  How can a young person look at this and not want something better? How can someone not want a more stable, reliable and secure future for himself, and potential partner + family? Even ""nerds"" like me who poured over books, and were top of the class, are not safe from loopholes. All my life I've been told ""just work hard and things will come""... My hard work got me in the field I studied for, but these fields were supposed to be different from the vast majority which take advantage of workers.  It was a rough wakeup call to realize even the dream places you wish to work at, follow the same tricks.  As long as the laws benefit the companies, and not the worker, the workers will of course go somewhere more stable.",2025-06-14T12:38:46Z,103

You can't even get an ID without police showing up first at your home, every time you change cities you need a new ID. There is no national standardization on public services. You can't resolve or require anything online, every time you need some governmental document you need to waste your time going to a different public office that will probably be closed when it should be open. Taxes are crushing.  --  To those saying I am lying:  If you live in Italy you need to register your residency to the anagrafic office at the comune, up to date ID, Codice Fiscale, Tessera Sanitaria and SPID. Also there is all the problens involving paying the taxes regarding the trash, gas bill. In most of Italy you can do none of these online apart from SPID. To rent an apartment most landlords require references. And to get a bank account or a job you need a fixed address which you will be unable to have unless you already have a job. This kind of dynamic creates vicious cycles. If you have no close relatives or is not the kind of person who seeks friendships you are fucked.  You can't even have a prepaid cellphone line without presenting an ID. 😂  If you live in the capitals you can find some things online, otherwise you are screwed. Rome right now has a 6 months to a year and a half wait time to get an ID.  You need to pay taxes on various documents emitted only by the commune automated systems. Why the hell should anyone pay 16 euros for a document with instantaneous automated emittion. Also, Italia doesn't even have the eletronic haia apostil. If you are abroad even in the EU and need any document translated you will need to pay a lawyer a base fee of 1500 euros to have a single document with the haia apostil.  Another Italian absurd is having to register you rent your property with government.",2025-06-14T09:59:33Z,198

You did a great job describing the harsh living and working conditions faced by young people in Italy today. Salaries are extremely low, while the cost of living keeps rising. Renting a decent home is often unaffordable, making it nearly impossible to plan a stable future with a partner.  I work in academic research, where the situation is especially dire: we are underfunded, and there’s no investment in innovation or in people. The work culture is deeply toxic — you’re expected to accept starvation wages, go through endless years of “paying your dues,” and work tirelessly in the hope of eventually moving up.  As a queer person, imagining a family with my boyfriend is basically out of reach — the social and legal context just doesn’t allow it (Italians are very conservative) .

Italy has been caught up in a doom loop I don't think will ever be unravelled. Not because of economic/social issues, but due to the absolute refusal of most Italians to turn things around. We mumble, insult politiciand, feel discouraged... but nobody actually wants to reform our country. I suppose we don't feel poverty-stricken enough yet, living off our parents' money as long as we can, and when the music stops it will be too late to move. We Italians have chosen to slowly die of consumption. A legitimate position (and very much deliberate too)... Fair. But I have tapped out. This is not what I want my future life to look like.

They’ll think you only “care about the money,” which is somehow seen as a red flag. But if you’re applying for a job with a lower salary range than your current one, why would you even consider switching unless they’re willing to match or exceed it? It’s bonkers to me that people aren’t comfortable talking about money - it’s usually one of the last topics brought up with recruiters, and always with a mix of fear and shame.  The truth is, it’s not just about taboo, it feels like a deeper cultural mechanism to keep you small. You’re not supposed to feel empowered or confident when negotiating; you’re expected to be grateful, passive, and to accept whatever is offered without question.

Also, I find it absurd that people are so against immigrants. For me it's not a matter of political orientation anymore, it is simply a matter of numbers. People want to have more babies (Italy is the country with the highest fertility gap in Europe) but do not have the conditions to do so. At the same time, current workers are supporting the pension system. Therefore, we need more people, or with an aging population, welfare overall will collapse. Since we aren't reversing the trend anytime soon, we need more immigrants, and we need to let them in NOW. It is such a simple equation, but the average Italian cannot grasp it.

At 17, I started suffering from debilitating chronic stomach pain, which lasted until I was 23, when I was finally diagnosed and got the right medication. In a matter of 2-3 years, I was symptom free, and in a few more years, I felt that the mental issues developed from living with a chronic disease had finally settled. At 31, I am living a completely normal life. I have critiques of the Danish healthcare system for some mismanagement of my disease (why did I have to suffer for 6 years?) but this isn't about my critiques, but my praise:  Due to my illness, it took me 8,5 years to finish a master's that should've taken 5,5 (managed to do the Master's on the numerated 2 after going through treatment and was so proud of that). Had I lived in the states, I would've been royally fucked. I would've had to drop my education or become severely indebted. As I had to study on less than full time, for obvious reasons, I couldn't have a job on the side - I could barely manage my studies. I was dependent on the student subsidies given to every student, as well as the low-rate loan available to students. I never had to stress about that part of the issue. I could stress about whether I'd ever be well again, whether I'd be able to hold down a job, etc. etc., but I NEVER DOUBTED I WOULD LIVE. Even if I'd have had to embrace a life of being severely disabled and living off the smallest subsidies, I would still have survived, I would still get medical aid, because in Denmark, we take care of each other.  Now, I'm on the other side and have worked full-time for 2 years at a well-paid job. I pay my high taxes happily, because I was given this opportunity, I was given that help, and that faith. I want to pass that on to others, and I want Denmark to remain a state where we are equal, where we all have basic human rights, where nobody is left in the gutter. When I calculate how much I've paid in taxes so far, I don't feel sad at lost money, I feel pride at my contribution.",2025-06-06T16:33:01Z,126

It's a very boomer heavy population, with very boomer centric politics - No taxation on profit from flipping property, primarily benefitting the old and wealthy, and those well-established on the housing market, creating a bubble-market and increasing the share of unproductive investments. Increasing gini coefficient. Lots of scandals in the healthcare system, with steady funding but an increasing burden not taken care of.  Government surplus, yes, but by lack of funding in daycare and public schools, stuffing more and more kids together each year. decreasing the quality in high-schools, cuts in student benefits, and closing down engineering degrees, among other things. Increase in manufacturing, yes, but it's low tech, and with very low innovation, on par with Thailand and Poland. And with no software or semiconductor industry to speak of. Unsustainable reproductive rate with low unemployment rate and low immigration, meaning an eventual catastrophic lack of workers and consumers.

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us.

It's not the same as in our home country. While we may be considered highly skilled and reliable workers back home, in Germany, you need to align with the local expectations — including soft skills, communication abilities, and especially fluency in German (ideally at the C1 level). German language certificates are not always necessary — what really matters is how well you can communicate during the interview. Also, based on my own experience and conversations with HR at my company, there is a common perception that many Indian candidates exaggerate or misrepresent their experience on their CVs, which creates mistrust.  Taking courses at German universities, even short-term Weiterbildung programs, can really help. Don’t rely solely on your Indian degrees — adapting to the local system makes a big difference.  — Response from a skilled immigrant working in Germany for 8 years to the indian girl in video (11:10)",2025-08-07T07:40:03Z,30

I am German and I have not only lived in Germany, but also in 2 other countries, but at no point have I ever expected to be accommodated in English or in German. The idea did not even occur in my mind. In fact I had learned the languages before going there and dedicated a lot of time and money to it so I could actually achieve a certificated C1 level for one country and a C2 for the other.  I don't think you absolutely need that I believe you will probably get by with a B2 level, but at the least you should have a B1 level.  It is one thing if you fled from another country, then you really have no chance to prepare for this, but if you actively choose a country, no matter which one, you absolutely do have the chance to prepare and you absolutely should!

 When I came over I did so with a direct contract, though, I did invest time in learning the language at least to a B2 level when I considered looking for a job here. And, while I have 8 years here, my language skills are far from what I want them to be, so I still, periodically, do language courses.
 Since then, with COVID and the drop in German Automotive industry, my company closed but my CEO collected a few of us and started a new one. So, in my 8 years, I collected unemployment for only 1 month.
 Switching out of the Automotive industry (where my main experience was) took about 1.5 - 2 years of constant learning, interviewing and self-correcting.
 I had a lot of interviews where I got to the end stage of the process but it took time, attention to what I could improve after each interview and a significant amount of energy and research. So, work through it, I'm not saying its 100% going to happen, but chances for skilled workers, with German language skills (even poor ones), are quite good in my experience.
 As for German bureaucracy, I come from Romania :) Germany does have more bureaucracy but I find it's functional and quite efficient. The social and taxation systems would probably not work as well without it. However, I do think a lot is over-regulated here and this is consistent with the opinion of my German colleagues :).
 
 What feel is missing and is becoming problematic is digitalization and quality of services. Most, from state provided services (finance, medical, city offices), to private, service oriented, businesses like banks and telecommunication are outdated, overpriced and of mediocre quality.
 
 All in, Germany is, for me, a lot better than Romania, the caveat being: your family and long-time friends are now a long way away. This is not a small factor in your quality of life. There are a lot of things to improve, but this is as much a chance as an issue, since you can be part of improving some aspects and helping your adoptive country.",2025-08-09T14:49:08Z,8

Every sales job I’ve worked at I’ve been the highest performing rep. However, both of the last companies I’ve worked for have gone out of business and I have been job hunting.  I pride myself on the fact that every job I’ve ever interviewed for I’ve gotten, but being unemployed has taught me how hard it is just to get an interview.  Hundreds of applications, most never get any response. Many entry level sales jobs (literally glorified calling centers) deny me because they say they are looking for someone with more relevant experience.   How is college, an MBA, and 5 years of being the top sales rep not good enough for entry level jobs??  A lot of people don’t realize how bad things are yet. If you’re in a job right now, feel grateful. It’s bad out here.  In the meantime, I have had to just uber. Luckily I have that, but with gas expenses I’m probably only making $14 an hour.

Even at minimum wage, I had management riding me nonstop to be faster every night I worked.  This was a minimum wage job, yet they treated it like Amazon warehouse where they keep pushing you every day you work to be faster and do more in less time.  I was written up for the dumbest stuff.  One night I was stocking I had 4 mixed pallets on one end of my aisle and 1 pallet of just my stuff at the other.  Management called me to the office and said they're writing me up for not working because that 1 pallet is still sitting there at the end of my aisle.  I explained he obviously didn't see the other 4 mixed pallets which my stuff on top buried everyone else's stuff underneath so I was trying to move that off and stock it because you're not supposed to leave boxes strewn across the floor.  Management said they didn't see it and apologized, but said they still had to write me up because they had already called me to the office and it would look bad on them for pulling me away from my work for nothing.  That was back in 2015.  I'm sure Walmart is a lot harder today.  I changed jobs went to a grocery store doing minimum wage.  The grocery store refused to provide benefits, so everyone was scheduled less than 20hrs/wk.  I had just graduated from college (in my 30s) and had 10 years of customer service/retail exp under my belt and they treat me like I'm below the high school kids they were hiring that sit around drinking gatorade and playing on their phones.  Anyway, minimum wage jobs for the past 10 years couldn't afford an apartment, and I'm sure nowadays they can't either.  My old apartment up near the university was across the street from the grocery store used to be $600/month.  Today, it's practically doubled in rent, and the neighborhood now has a lot of problems with drugs.  A nice apartment in that university town you're looking at paying $3k+ for a single.  I left to China in 2019 because I couldn't find a job with my BA degree from the university right there in that town.  The Career Center at the university kept telling me to apply for GEICO insurance because they just opened new offices and needed help.  Her husband worked there.  I applied and went through round 1 of interviews 3 times.  They always ghost me after that.  So one day I called GEICO and asked to speak with the HR because I really wanted to know yes or no whether I got the job.  They told me the HR will be working on Thursdays.  I called back on Thursday, and the HR was out of town down in Florida on a family vacation.  I'm sitting there like, ""you could have told me she was going to be out of the office this thursday, call back next thursday, but you didn't.""  Felt like they just were making up stories and the job postings on Indeed might have been fake to appear like they're hiring when they were not.  I was also upset with the career center for not helping me find work.  You would think the school would be helping graduates find work because it'd show that their university degrees actually have value!  Instead, they didn't help me.  I had to go out and find my own job teaching in China.  I wish I could end there, but covid started 6 months after I arrived.  Their visa situation was chaos and my visa expired during a lockdown, so I couldn't get another work visa and I had to return home.  Now I'm jobless, living at home, taking care of my grandmother that was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  If she goes into a nursing home, we'll lose the house.  I've tried finding work when I came home from China, but employers just laugh me out the door.  The only type of job hiring right now is heavy industrial, and I don't have any heavy industrial skills.  I'm an academic, not a tradesman.  You say the job market is on the edge?  I'd say it's already collapsed when even young generation are struggling to find entry level positions and salaries everywhere are not keeping up with inflation and the rising cost of living.",2025-09-02T05:00:45Z,93

It's not at all like moving from California to Idaho; there is quite a process to go through. Incl. depositing 12x mininum local salary, buying private health insurance, etc. I had to apply for a Bulstat number, and to do that you are required to go through local lawyers/accountants. Good ones are hard to find and charge a lot; plus they love to unexpectedly up their fees by 20%-30% because ""inflation.""  The income tax I pay is 10% minus 4% flat expenses = 6%. Sounds fantastic. Except the mandatory social security contributions are €600 per month (regardless of whether you’ve had any income during that month or not). In much wealthier Czech/Slovakia, those are about €200 per month. And if you are a day late with the payments, the government is already charging you interest/penalty.  Lastly, I bought a one-bedroom condo unit. A ""management company"" swooped in and started charging €700+ in annual maintenance fees. For that, they provide nothing. No service contract and no one as much as mops the floor  outside my apartment all year long. On top of that, they're now in court with another ""management company."" Depending on the outcome, I may have to pay the fees a second time, all over again.  1 liter of milk costs €1 in Austria, €0.69 in Slovakia. My local Billa sells it for €2.00 - local Bulgarian milk, mind you. A 100-mile taxi ride to the airport, in my old country, sets you back €80; here it's €150. And that's before the upcoming switch to euro in January 2026.  So that's a foreigner's life in Bulgaria.

But i definitely think the quality of life is great. I think a lot of people downplay the safety, cleanliness and services you can get. Now yes, you may find some more safe and clean places in Asia. But we have a good package too i would say. Things are always subjective. I can't really stand heat / above 24°c, i like cold weather. I can't imagine myself living in a permanent tropical climate. For other people this sounds like a dream. So maybe Finland or Iceland would be more suitable to me and Malaysia or Oman to someone else. It'll be hard to find vegan food in Asia, in most of Europe that's pretty easy. Not many people will care about this but personally i do. It all has its ups and downs. If you are poor it's ""great"" (in quotes of course - being poor is obviously never great, but relatively speaking in comparison to other places). If you are so rich that you hardly care about the taxes and fees you gotta pay it's great for the quality of life. If you are somewhere in between i can see the reservations to be honest.

Specifically, here in France, food quality standards are light years better than they were back in the US, and of course I don’t even have to compare them to China. And as parents of a young daughter, who is now growing up trilingual (and with a US passport and eventually a FR one too) as a result of our mixed cultural backgrounds and our chosen home here, we’re thrilled with the choice we made.

In Italy, yes, you can just bring your spouse.  He / She can get a 5 year spousal visa with no language requirements.  Then the spouse can upgrade to permanent residency.  Austria, on the other hand, requires your spouse to have an A1 German language certificate as a start to get a 1 year visa to stay with you.  If your spouse resists wanting to learn another language, this can make it harder to keep the family together.  (this situation only applies if your spouse is NOT an EU citizen otherwise they have the right of free movement without further language restrictions)  If I am not mistaken, when that visa comes up for renewal after only one year, the spouse has to up the skills to A2 German to show that ""integration"" is progressing.  Like Italy, at the 5 year mark, the spouse can go for permanent residency.  Separately but related to language...  If you come from the US, Austria will let you convert your driver's license to an Austrian one which will then be valid for driving in all of the EU.  Even if you started from scratch, Austria will let you take the classes in English or German.  However, Italy will only let you drive on your US license for 1 year.  Then you MUST start from scratch and go through Italian driver's education in Italian with no option to do it in English.  Just a couple of things to keep in mind.",2025-04-24T21:10:01Z,20

I don’t buy it—not for most. Especially for people coming from poorer countries.  In reality, the majority of migration patterns make sense when you follow jobs or government welfare.  Take the U.S., Canada, Germany, or the UK. Why are they popular destinations? Not just because they’re “free” countries, but because they offer either (a) better job markets in the Western version of capitalism, or (b) generous social systems. And yes, sometimes both.  Look at Sweden, Germany, or the Netherlands—countries with robust welfare states. A lot of migrants aim there because once you’re in the system, there’s a safety net: housing, healthcare, education, etc. It’s not exactly about bootstrapping yourself up through entrepreneurship. Thing is it does not help those whom are native. If anything it puts more drain on their system.  Meanwhile, other migrants aim for places like the U.S. or Canada where it’s more about economic opportunity and work visas, not free housing.  Then there’s the language and culture aspect. Migrating from the U.S. to the UK or Ireland? Totally makes sense. There’s linguistic and cultural overlap. But U.S. to Bulgaria? That’s way more rare. Just like a Bulgarian moving to China isn’t exactly common either.  Why? Because if someone was purely chasing economic growth and opportunity, China—with its massive industrial expansion and growing middle class—should be a hotspot. But it’s not. Why? Because that person isn’t necessarily chasing raw growth or capitalism. They’re chasing a Western-style social system with free education, healthcare, housing benefits, and residency rights.  So it’s less about “freedom” and more about which country hands out the better freebie deal.  If the average migrant was an entrepreneur at heart, they’d go where the frontier is wide open—maybe parts of Asia, Africa, or even South America. But most don’t. They head to where they can plug into an existing system and live decently, even if they don’t become rich.  Not saying that’s wrong, just saying let’s be honest about it and cut the BS.",2025-04-22T22:46:51Z,29

The second problem is that at the low end of the income scale, you're often far better off choosing benefits as a career than a minimum wage job due to the differences in support schemes and taxes. Hence the massive increase in claims for nebulous conditions like ""anxiety"" or ""ADHD"", especially among young people.   The solution is to look to Denmark, where employment rights are surprisingly limited and make it easy to hire and fire employees. However, they can do this because fired workers get quite a generous amount of support from the welfare system, but that support is limited in time and scope. You're strongly pushed into training courses or looking for a job, and it'll get yanked after a couple of years. That means there's a good safety net that is only temporary, and businesses are more willing to hire people, safe in the knowledge that they can be binned off if they don't work out.",2025-11-13T13:45:10Z,3

Competing with world wide high skill developers and cheaper it not an easy thing and you need to make more impact as the video suggests.   I feel really bad about jrs developers. Competing with middle and even seniors leave them without chance.

Every job is a challenge and a compromise and the further you get out from your comfort home or country the more challenging it gets. That is where Indian youths who have been pampered at home fail abroad with social adjustment in a new society. They are home sick all the time. They should be concentrating on learning new language, new culture, new skills, seeing new places, experiencing the diversity and nature and even enjoying the quietness and lonliness filled with personal advancement. Glad that you pointed out many of these things here. Europe or any where else is definitely not a bed of roses. Nobody is waiting for you with open arms to give you a job, a home or a car. It is a healthy struggle here all the way minus nepotism, corruption, unequality and injustice which you are hopefully trying to get away from.",2025-08-17T10:46:07Z,0

It simply doesn't make sense to hire and train junior people when your company outlook is measured in quarters rather than decades, because they represent high risk of failure on critical short-term deadlines, compounded by high indirect cost to the productivity of the senior people that train them and could otherwise be focussed fully on critical tasks, both of which are naturally compounded by AI as an alternative, but existed well before it.  Add the pattern of company hopping that's more and more popular, which effectively means that training new people is paying for their next employer's benefit more than your own, and it's not hard to see why companies just don't want to deal with entry level people any more.  Of course, that's unsustainable in the long run, but for that, see both of the above: in a business where your incentives are quarterly and *you* expect to jump after a few years too, the long run is some future employee's problem, not yours.  Eventually I think we'll end up needing policy incentives for what I think of as ""sustainable hiring"" where there are subsidies or similar cost offsetting measures in place to encourage the creation of early career positions and training, because as senior people leave the workforce into retirement, there won't be enough young people gaining the experience to replace them, and that's not something companies are likely to fix for themselves in the current environment.",2025-12-02T16:43:14Z,127

This means that if you have 50 similar jobs with 50 interested people, in the past they would probably spread out between these jobs and every job only got a few replies. but now people just reply to pretty much all of these jobs.

The issue is that when they fire the educated people and let non-educated people promt the AI, they produce sub-par product. That in turn leads to a decrease in quality of the end product, which in turn leads to less customer retention.  The effect isn't immediate, but give it a few more years and alot of large companies will suffer incredibly. Companies who hire real people with real skills will see the biggest return on investment.

There's like 1.5x or less variation, that cannot be called ""must harder to find a job"". And the rest of the video is trying to explain why unemployment rate is rising (insignificantly), while in the beginning we saw that it's not rising (almost).  My one hypothesis for now is that while unemployment rate is constant, it may be still harder to change a job — it may be less people taking more time to find a new job, so the total number time×people is approximately constant. In case of IT it could be, for example, that companies consider much more candidates before choosing one due to some cultural shift after COVID, and that causes candidates to send much more resumes and spend much more time to find a new job (I mean AI resume filtering stage + more interviews for more candidates before hiring + more remote jobs to choose from a larger candidate pool). That's an assumption, I don't have hard data for this except for long term unemployment that grows faster than simple unemployment since early 2023.

If the law won’t punish those who cause damage to the people, no matter how much money and perks they offer, no amount or package will be  enough to restore the faith and trust in those companies. People will remember how companies treated them during interviews and after they got laid off.

So jobs remain published on portals even though the company is no longer accepting applications. 2] Several job portals/aggregators keep reposting old/expired job ads to attract candidates and expand their databases.

One thing not talked about much is that so much of this work is now done through contractors and vendors. You get a 6 month contract, you're nearing the end of it so you start looking for your next gig. Recuiters don't need you in 3 weeks at the end of your contract. They need you today.

Fake job ...",2025-07-15T17:15:04Z,@ramkumarrealm,"Current Challenges in the Tech Job Market Massive Layoffs: Over 260,000 tech jobs were cut globally in 2023, followed by 150,000+ in 2024 and 25,000+ in 2025.  Automation Impact: Nearly 50% of executives report increased automation, replacing mid-level engineering and administrative roles.  Fake Job Listings: 55% of tech companies post fake job ads, with 70% of recruiters considering it acceptable.  Low Interview Rates: Only 8% of tech job applicants receive interview responses, down from 12% in previous years.  Corporate Ghosting: Many applicants receive no response even after multiple interview rounds.  Longer Job Searches: The average time to secure a tech job in the U.S. has risen from 3 to 5+ months.  Mental Health Strain: Endless rejections and ghosting have led to widespread frustration among job seekers.  Decline in Entry-Level Roles: Entry-level tech job postings dropped by 30% in the UK and over 70% for software developers in the U.S. (2023-2025).  Rising Unemployment: IT sector unemployment reached 5.5% in May 2025, surpassing the national average.  Shifts in Hiring and Job Demand AI-Driven Job Growth: AI-related roles (machine learning, data science, cloud computing) are growing despite declines in traditional tech jobs.  Changing Skill Requirements: Companies now prioritize practical certifications over traditional degrees.  Fewer General IT Jobs: Tech support and generic software engineering roles are shrinking.  New Job Creation: AI is generating demand for specialized roles (AI scientists, cybersecurity experts, data architects).  Struggles for New Graduates: Unemployment for recent graduates is at 7%, the highest in a decade, with 30-40% fewer entry-level openings.  Visa Challenges: Over 10,000 H1B visa holders lost jobs in 2023, with many struggling to find new placements.  Future Projections & Recovery Selective Recovery: The job market is rebounding slowly but unevenly, favoring niche AI and automation-related roles.  18% Growth in Tech Jobs: The U.S. Department of Labor predicts 350,000+ new tech jobs annually by 2034, mostly in AI and cybersecurity.  No Return to Pre-2022 Levels: The market won’t regain its 2021-2022 hiring peaks; instead, it will become more specialized.  Permanent Structural Changes: Mass hiring and extravagant perks are fading as companies prioritize efficiency and automation.  Adaptation Required: Job seekers must upskill in AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity to remain competitive.",2025-07-16T02:17:04Z,0

Mainly because nowadays many sectors equipped with expertise with IT plus skills. Unlike before, they need to hire specific people to do most IT related things in the office. But now, not anymore. For example, I work as a bioinformatician. Before, my expertise only doing work about biology and the information parts is handled by tech people. But now, many biologist can do both, so it allows the company to focus more on productivity with less employees. The same applies to many fields, such as analytical chemistry and GIS, where IT is required, but those fields still need a human brain to run.

The outsourcing factor seems EXTREMELY RELEVANT as people consider devoting years of their life to learn AI/ Cloud Security/ Network Engineering/ Machine Learning skills only to not be able to land jobs in the future because many of those positions will be outsourced for much cheaper labor. One sub-field that I have looked into that seems to be a little more secure is cybersecurity (at least in the public arena) being that government and public agencies would probably not outsource many positions outside of the country. I would like to know what everybody's thoughts are on this idea, as well as if there are many positions to go into in cybersecurity THAT ARE NOT  HIGH STRESS? All insights are appreciated.

More than 20 years ago, I started as a school teacher in Singapore (high school math and cs) but left teaching to join tech industry. AT that time, the multimedia side of tech was hot and hip. I left a full government job for multimedia! 😅 over the years, I’ve managed both systems and multimedia development projects. Now, I return to the classroom in Canada, teaching math, cs and tech related subjects in high school. I am looking closely at the scores of unemployed new cs graduates because part of my job is to encourage students to make IT their life long career😅. I think the current situation is an over supply of IT professionals many of whom did not major in AI development and machine learning (robotics) or automation. AI has changed the nature of tech jobs. New graduates must adapt to new realities, adapt to using AI instead, in the work place, do not define what is coding and what is not coding, instead just get the job done in the most efficient time saving way. I also think that most tech jobs are taken by new immigrants (in Canada), only top local graduates from top universities find work or like what you mentioned, those with connections. Over the years, I’ve come to think that cs graduates should be licensed like engineers, accountants, doctors, nurses and teachers. As for current job situation, they should apply into management roles if there are fewer entry level positions. AI has created new positions, even a team of robots need to be managed and maintained. I don’t see IT (including multimedia) management positions going away anytime soon. In fact, coding jobs are not going away either, it’s coding AI software that is in demand, the bar has been raised very high, there is a merger of mechanical, electrical engineering with computer science.",2025-10-13T13:17:30Z,0

As someone who has done extensive research on this topic and actually made contact with people who are doing their post graduation in these countries. What he is saying is the absolute truth USA is the easiest to get into for medical pg. Even in australia you won't get any specialisation of your choice even if you clear both amc exams , the specialities you get are only the seats leftover after all Aussie graduates are taken (doctors are less in australia but so are colleges that produce them)  - and there are few specialities like emergency medicine left for imgs. As of UK plab isn't ur license to specialisation in the uk it is just an exam you pass to work in UK after clearing plab you still have to pass mrcp / mrcog / mrcs .etc which 70% people who are doctors in the UK fail to pass. Not to mention the job scarcity even after clearing plab 1 and plab 2 due to inflation. The salary in nhs is barely liveable in uk , laymen get paid more than doctors in uk. So yes usa has the least discrimination against foreign doctors and the only hurdle is usmle atleast they guarantee a job in specialities like internal medicine , family medicine and emergency medicine if you perform well in usmle and play your cards right from the start.",2025-12-16T13:42:28Z,0

Unlike the US, UK, and other countries where students often stay and work permanently, this is not typically the case in Germany. While it's possible to find lower-level jobs that don't match your qualifications simply because you're fluent in German, this isn't a sustainable long-term strategy. High taxes and living costs mean that you probably won't become wealthy; instead, you'll live an average life. Additionally, there's intense competition, and employers tend to favor native Germans over migrants.   German employers also usually prefer candidates from prestigious US and British universities like Yale or Cambridge over student immigrants with a university degree from Germany. This is a fact. They often welcome international students primarily for economic reasons, not necessarily to provide more employment opportunities. I know an American who studied here,  became fluent in German (C1 level), speaking almost like a native, but she told me most employers rejected her in favor of native Germans. She eventually returned to the US.   So, believing that studying in Germany will guarantee a job afterward is an illusion. There are already highly qualified refugees from other countries who are unemployed here. Many YouTube channels don't have a thorough understanding of the German system; while some are relatively trustworthy, they still lack complete knowledge and experience. Comparatively, this YouTube is genuine, although the guy didn't cover some other facts, which I can understand may be due to a lack of knowledge of the German system.",2025-08-27T09:32:15Z,16

Learn to read write and speak impeccable English language. 2. Look into the career page of software companies in USA. 3. Learn the skills which are mentioned in those job postings. It would take you more than 7 years to master those skills. Do not go to any school or college in India. 4. Try to become internationally known professional on your area of expertise. Try to help the professionals working in the developed countries on your area of expertise. Impress them with your skills. They would hire you.

I strongly agree with the idea that we should prioritize fundamentals rather than chasing every new AI update. However, I can’t ignore how rapidly things have changed. Just 3 years ago, there were no AI tools that could write code for us. Back then, knowing Python and SQL was enough to land my first job. Today, those same tasks can often be handled by AI.  That said, AI still struggles with areas like system design, architecture, performance optimization, and understanding the “why” behind production decisions.

Companies grabbed these low wage workers as fast as they could 15 years ago and people like me, a farm worker at the time, couldn't get a job anywhere unless I took a 30-50% pay cut. Because people like me, a lifelong UK citizen, couldn't get a job younger people wouldn't train up for an industry that couldn't provide them a job with a liveable wage so we end up with a skills shortage. Now we have a country that's utilised cheap foreign labour for years and industries that now struggle to find people because the cheap workers have gone home and no-one is there to replace them. The wages are too low now for people living here to afford a reasonable standard of living, try getting a mortgage on £25k/year, energy costs at an all time high, fuel costs the same, rents are extortionate, no housing available unless you come here illegally, taxation at stupid levels.  I'm 57 and will be moving to the Philippines in the next 12-15 years as my GF is a citizen out there, she's coming to the UK soon and we're getting married and applying for her UK citizenship. That is at a cost of £7-£10k and I wonder how a penniless illegal affords that?? We have a house and business out in the Ph and I pay 8% tax instead of 40% in the UK, electric is about £50/month instead of £200+, fuel is at about 80p/l, my shopping is £60 instead of over £100 here for similar items, the cost of living is a lot lower and my life there will be no different than it is here in the UK.

Not that long ago, companies would train their own staff from ""the bottom"", which allowed more people to enter the company through entry-level jobs and progress to more skilled and senior roles as they worked and learned over the years. Now they require qualifications that are never tailored to the specific job or company, and quite often these are a requirement for entry-level jobs. It looks like they are saving on training staff, but the little training they save, it's not worth it. Companies had better employees back when they trained them from the very beginning, and they often had them for their entire working life. Back when I was in Spain during the construction boom, there was no shortage of ""qualified builders"", lots of 16-year-old kids would leave school and start learning from 0 as they worked in construction, and nobody had a problem with that. But here we need ""qualified construction workers"", or we don't give them a chance. Greed and stupidity ruined the job market.",2025-03-29T19:34:10Z,9

Because it has become so unrealistic it is eating away at everyone’s income per month.  To keep up with mortgages or rents.  It is killing everyone’s disposable income and because no one has money or ie enough money.  To spend in discretionary side of the economy.  This is why we have this flat curve.  In my opinion.  We have a housing bubble from one side of the world to the other.  The problem is it is slow to correct.  To fair market values.  Based on the incomes of said areas.  If the governments were serious about fixing this they would try and free up peoples income.  So debts could be paid and people had something more to spend.  But all these officials live in their own glass houses unaware of how hard things have become.,2025-11-18T19:10:07Z,2

Rent, groceries, healthcare, car costs have grown much faster than wages on median. 2) outsourcing is a much higher threat than AI.  Millions of foreign workers that speak English are taking western (UK, USA, Canada) jobs at a much faster rate than AI in the next 5-10 years. 3) remote work makes #2 worse.  I get it, I love remote working, but if you think your company cares enough about you to not replace you you’re dead wrong.  If you think you’re irreplaceable you might be right, but that won’t stop your company from replacing you with 2-3 workers in a lower wage country and saving half or 2/3 your costs even if it losses them money in the end. 4) Productivity isn’t falling, companies are in a non spoken agreement to pay as absolutely little as they possibly can and making the hiring process as painful as possible to make people unwilling to change.  The growth in productivity is going to the top 0.1%. 5) I am a mid level professional with nearly 20 years experience in my field, I applied to over 2,000 to get 4 offers, I was well qualified for all of them, this is the worst job market I’ve seen except for 2008-2011.

I was practically starving working jobs that paid eight dollars an hour after I earned my bachelors degree, and it forced me to go into the trades where I was able to earn $12-$15 per hour. I stuck with the trades for only a few years because I topped out at 15 bucks an hour. I am educated in both STEM and social sciences.
