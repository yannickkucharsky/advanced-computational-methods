I like that this song, instead of focusing on the animatronic side of the horror, it focuses more on the human side of it. This aspect is not usually explored in FNAF songs and oh boy is it terrifying. One could argue that its scarier than the animatronics. It deals with ethics and morals that are constantly broken in reward for profit. It's sort of grimy and filthy in a way. I think that this is a very special addition to the FNAF song collection. All of the others are dark electronic songs while this one is upbeat, but even darker. Some of the visuals are actually quite disturbing. I adore this song. It might even be my favorite for its different take on the whole formula.",2018-03-06T01:59:43Z,250

But that basically means the introverts with amazing education & history will be more than likely pushed aside over an extrovert that did well in the interview.   Also the question: Tell me about yourself, needs to be abolished. Work is work, I don't want my employer knowing about my personal life. Everything they need, they already have on the CV that was sent to them.

I have repeatedly reviewed the behavioral and situational questions you recommended and have found them to be helpful in reinforcing tips such as listening carefully, taking time to organize ideas, practicing beforehand, be specific, drawing from experiences in different fields including volunteering (which I usually never discuss unless asked), and not hesitating to ask politely for clarification if needed. It's also important to control anxiety through meditation and journaling, and to break the ice with small talk at the beginning of the interview. Additionally, practicing with another English speaker, talking to a mirror, or recording videos to check body language and intonation can help project the right image and leadership. Thank you for sharing this training material.",2023-04-06T18:03:41Z,4

According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, all across the country, teachers pay a financial penalty to serve the public mission of educating our kids instead of entering more lucrative professions. In my state that penalty is 16 cents to every dollar. When benchmarked with median household income, teachers in my state make the 9th lowest salary in the nation. Combined with the fact that we have the lowest teacher working conditions in the country, and that budgets are still being cut left and right, class sizes increasing, 30+ teaching positions being eliminated, it's no wonder that they're outsourcing these jobs to the lowest bidder. When the most important in-school factor in a child's education is the quality of teaching they receive, why would you put a larger focus on money than on the future of your country?",2019-12-25T03:30:20Z,145

So many companies write generic job descriptions that sound exactly like their competitors, then wonder why they attract the wrong people. I've been working with companies on this exact problem, and here's what I've noticed: when you SHOW your culture instead of just describing it, everything changes. A 2-minute video of your actual team interacting, your real workspace, how decisions get made - that tells candidates more than any ""we're like a family"" job posting ever could.  The best part? People who don't fit your culture will self-select out before applying. You get fewer applications, but they're from people who actually WANT to work in your environment. It's like dating - you want someone who's excited about the real you, not some generic version you think they want to see. Have you experimented with video content to showcase culture authentically?

First, one needs to read the entire recipe.  Then you have to look over the ingredients, make sure you have them on hand and in the qty needed, make a list of what you don't have or need and go to the store and get it.  You also have to make sure you have the equipment.  Don't have a grater?  A juicer?  A masher?  Go get one or figure out a way using what you do have.  Then you need to organize everything.  Wet ingredients, dry ingredients what bowl sizes to hold what until you're ready to combine get the pots or cooker out.  Then you need to be able to measure.  Then you need to follow instructions.  There may be some element of timing involved. Marinate for a 8 hours or let soak for one hour, pre-heat the oven 15 minutes before placing roast to cook for one hour per lb.  So to be a GOOD cook, it requires certain skills.  Time management, organization, ability to follow an instructions.

I don't find his mindset effective in the long-term at all.  A recruiter's life isn't easy when you ""select the right person."" Selecting is one thing, keeping them is a whole other skill set. Also, affecting culture shouldn't be a major priority of a company in hiring. People adapt to cultures if they value either the culture they're inserted in or what they're gaining from it, and the person's culture can contribute to making your company culture better and less myopic. A lot of great talent is wasted because companies learn to become obsessed about culture. Some people are perfectly happy just coming to work and being proud at doing their job well instead of having to fit in a culture. If you hire for culture, you hire personalities, not talent. More importantly, recruiters are terrible at putting themselves in the candidate's shoes and figuring out what the job will help fulfill in the life of that candidate. That's the most important piece if you want to keep them for a long time.",2023-09-18T19:00:51Z,1

To detect real and fake currency. Money is only as good as the value backing it. There is fake money some of this has been used in schools to teach bank tellers how to count like Monopoly money. This type of money is only good for a board game. Not real currency. Many people do not realize when the civil war happened currency changed. Every dollar every nickle every bill is dated. There were time when wooden buckled were made and tried to be passed off as govt money. There was also historically the problem with confederate and Union currency when it was first printed. Much of it had no backing during the war. Currency is an agreement between two parties. The natives used beads and Pearl and bits of gold for currency. Even a check may not be real. These are written from one person bank account to another. If the forger gets ahold of the addresses the check may in fact be fake. We had a case come through our bank which I was extremely convincing but fake. It was determined when they came through. The same goes for an original painting. There are prints and there’s originals. An original is just that no two paintings are like it. If a check is written but all parties do not agree… that is the bank and all customers involved it is then not cashed and is fake or voided. Currency changes over the years. Manhattan island actually was sold by the Indians for a pocket full of beads. You can not travel across the country with unlimited amounts of cash. Duty must be paid while traveling upon each entry. My father managed a bank and I share a home with a customs officer. I hope I was sufficient at explaining. My father bank was robbed three times as I worked there. They had a safe down stairs they would direct the armed robbers to it was a colorfully black painted Debolt safe. It was within the vault. It did not open. Once the robber was inside they merely stepped out and locked the vault. The robber was watched with camera then apprehended. But it was not easy for the manager. He had years of military service before accepting this position. Down to the penny money was counted and tellers had to work overnight to settle accounts. Things were done by hand in passbooks.,2023-07-13T18:58:43Z,1

As far as the US domestic league is concerned if you compare it to power houses yea we can't touch them. You have to realize not only how young this league is, but also how young the academies are. Realistically I don't think we've given it enough time to judge it fairly, but not only that if we look at the improvement of the MLS on a 5 year increment bases they've kept on growing in talent and popularity. I think it's important not to get impatient. In time, once we can produce good players in our academies we can look at pro/rel, but as of now that's not going to solve our problems mainly because we won't have as many people willing to invest in soccer. I mean how are the lower end teams going to stay alive if soccer isn't even that popular in our country. Once we can start producing great player then ok, maybe by then the interest will have increase to have enough fans to help support their local clubs. The problems always come down to money. If you're paying attention there have been various changes, especially when it comes to the quantity of players that we're helping develop, but like I said even our development academies are relatively young. I'm not even sure we've had anyone go from playing in the MLS youth development to amateur teams (the U.S. Soccer Development Academies were started in 2007) we may have kids that started playing at 11, but realistically any star players in most sports start younger.",2018-09-09T04:17:41Z,3

With colleges so expensive,  star players are going to use their talent to get a college degree.  The MSL is not the NBA where first round selections become multi millionaires. College does not develop players like a pro team would.  The pay to play systems leave out the less affluent making soccer like Tennis.   States have rules about out of season coaching.  In my state they can not even meet with the kids to talk about soccer during the offseason.   Maybe this works for football and basketball  but not a super high skilled sport like soccer.  THe overall level needs to improve.   I played against Danny Cantor in club, college, and in a scrimmage against the USMNT.   So part of his development was playing against myself and teammates for 600+ minutes of his soccer development.

Under him the US was clearly the best team in the region, qualified for the world cup, got out of the group of death and beat more top ranked teams than any previous coach, while playing a more attacking form of soccer. It only went wrong due to the egos of the American players who stopped playing for him because he was calling them out. When Besler and Morris turned down moves to the EPL and Bundesliga to stay in the MLS, Jurgen called them out. You look now and Klinsmann was right because both players have stagnated in the MLS and wasted what potential they had. Jurgen wanted to change the US system for the better. He was the only person in US soccer that wanted to get rid of the pay to play system and said there wasn't enough working class White Black and Latino players in the US system.

Rather than adopting his methods to the players he has, he's trying to make players fit into his system. Fuck that noise. At the highest club level you can put any player at any place on the pitch and they'll do fine. That's because they're the best players in the world. Berhalter is apparently just another arrogant American who thinks his science of the game is better than others. He has completely destroyed the confidence of his defensive players with his ridiculous demand that they NEVER push the fucking ball forward if there's a chance to pass it backward. With his ridiculous play we've seen over and over that the worst thing to happen is you turn the ball over 25 meters from the goal ... let them fucking clear the ball once in a while and the worst thing to happen is you make the other team go 100 yards to get to your gaol.

There is no way college kids can become world class players in enough quantity to form consecutive winning teams. The secondary leagues will force teams to pickup players and form a base for the future.  That's the problem...MLS clubs and players have no concept of battling all season not only for the win but also for not loose.  Loosing has consequences and not everyone takes a medal home. We can't even beat the Central America clubs for the club World Cup finals every December in Japan and this year I believe in Saudi Arabia. American coach such as Bruce Arena is not a world class coach, they are all outdated and whoever is deciding the future of the USA football has no knowledge on how to create a winning league.",2019-09-08T04:38:27Z,4
