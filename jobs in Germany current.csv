I was nearly homeless four years ago when my landlady gave me only four weeks notice of rental contract termination. It was horrible... nobody even wanted to rent me a WG room because I am PhD student with ridiculously low-income and short-term working contracts with no guarantees of extension. Only few days before my rental contract ended I managed to get a place to stay which is in horrible conditions - in the cellar, no sunlight, full of mold, horrible plumping issues, constant backflow of sewage water in the shower cabin which of course gives horrible smell. And of course in the middle of nowhere, super far from the city center and from my university. Of course my landlords violate many laws in here. Of course they knew I am a  poor Eastern European PhD student living from paycheck to paycheck in this expensive city all by myself, and I cannot afford hiring a lawyer against them. It was the biggest mistake of my life to start PhD in Munich... Luckily this nightmare is coming to the end, hopefully I will get my degree in summer and next month I am finally leaving Germany for good! :)",2025-05-01T20:38:29Z,382

It's not the same as in our home country. While we may be considered highly skilled and reliable workers back home, in Germany, you need to align with the local expectations — including soft skills, communication abilities, and especially fluency in German (ideally at the C1 level). German language certificates are not always necessary — what really matters is how well you can communicate during the interview. Also, based on my own experience and conversations with HR at my company, there is a common perception that many Indian candidates exaggerate or misrepresent their experience on their CVs, which creates mistrust.  Taking courses at German universities, even short-term Weiterbildung programs, can really help.

Interestingly, I also noticed that another company — I won’t name which — offers the same position in two different countries, one of which is German-speaking. Yet neither of those roles required a C2 level of German, only a B2 level.  So I asked why C2 fluency was required for the same job in Germany, but I never received a response. I work in this field, so I know firsthand that interaction with colleagues is minimal, and the office language is English, by the way. It really highlights how, at times, Germany makes it harder for highly skilled immigrants to stay and work, simply because they choose to. And they use language as an excuse.",2025-08-01T08:03:51Z,40

I don't think you absolutely need that I believe you will probably get by with a B2 level, but at the least you should have a B1 level.  It is one thing if you fled from another country, then you really have no chance to prepare for this, but if you actively choose a country, no matter which one, you absolutely do have the chance to prepare and you absolutely should!

And, while I have 8 years here, my language skills are far from what I want them to be, so I still, periodically, do language courses. Since then, with COVID and the drop in German Automotive industry, my company closed but my CEO collected a few of us and started a new one. So, in my 8 years, I collected unemployment for only 1 month. Switching out of the Automotive industry (where my main experience was) took about 1.5 - 2 years of constant learning, interviewing and self-correcting. I had a lot of interviews where I got to the end stage of the process but it took time, attention to what I could improve after each interview and a significant amount of energy and research. So, work through it, I'm not saying its 100% going to happen, but chances for skilled workers, with German language skills (even poor ones), are quite good in my experience. As for German bureaucracy, I come from Romania :) Germany does have more bureaucracy but I find it's functional and quite efficient. The social and taxation systems would probably not work as well without it. However, I do think a lot is over-regulated here and this is consistent with the opinion of my German colleagues :).  What feel is missing and is becoming problematic is digitalization and quality of services. Most, from state provided services (finance, medical, city offices), to private, service oriented, businesses like banks and telecommunication are outdated, overpriced and of mediocre quality.  All in, Germany is, for me, a lot better than Romania, the caveat being: your family and long-time friends are now a long way away. This is not a small factor in your quality of life.

Aapki inspiring story sun ke aisa laga jaise main bhi isi job mein phasa hua hoon. Aaj socha Spanish kaise sikhun kam time mein, to aapki video show hui. Socha, German na sahi, at least ek story to sun sakta hoon. Jab maine video open kiya, to aisa laga jaise meri hi story chal rahi ho. Bahut accha laga — aapne sab kuch itni detail mein samjhaya. Main motivate hua, lekin mujhe discipline lana hoga. Aur shayad mujhe bhi job se break lena hoga, tabhi main bhi aapki tarah Spain ja paunga. Warna yahin reh jaunga.

I am a German and lived in the USA for 12 years, but did not work there and my husband is American. Still....the experience is similar. You always experience a culture shock, even when you come from a similar one. Anyway...to fully enjoy the new culture you have to learn everything about it and you have to adjust. The new culture will not adjust to you. Learning the native language is the most important thing. Germans expect you to speak German, in France they expect you to speak French etc. At work you might get away with English, but when you want your electricity to be cut on or whatever you need to speak the native language of the country you live in. Just because English is the widely spread language you cannot expect that everybody can speak two languages. In the US nobody would expect that amybody knows the Italian or German language. About the handshake....Take my word for it...when you grow up with it, it is a normal thing and the way we say hello. And yes, when you shake anybody's hand you look in the eyes of that person. Anything else would not make any sense. And I agree...before anybody moves to another country they should learn about the culture beforehand. What you do inside your home is up to you, but when you step outside please show respect to the country you live in. When my girlfriend came for a visit to the USA she wanted to sunbath top less at the community pool. It took me a long time to convince her that she cannot to this in the USA. To her it was so normal that she could not get her head wrapped around it that she could end up in jail in the US for doing so. It is really important to know about the culture if you plan to live there. It also helps to talk to natives and show interest. They love to learn about your culture also.",2025-08-31T06:31:40Z,11

I compare and contrast this to people who have spend the same amount of time in USA or Australia and feel more at home there. The other major point of assimilation is how we have been open to the culture and relationships in the adopted Country. Did we marry there, did we raise our kids to think like a local or think like an Indian, do you enjoy and partake in local sports, or stick to only cricket. Do you volunteer your time for the good of local people or work for agencies that help out locals? How have you inserted yourself into becoming one with your neighborhood town/city? These things make a huge difference in the way you assimilate into a new culture OR you can remain an expat and take your wealth and go back to India in retirement.

Since then prices are stagnant.  Now that decade was an exception caused by extraordinarily low interest rates that effectively induced a real estate bubble.  The next decade is very unlikely to see the same growth in prices, so basically up to 2023 it was really hard to lose money with real estate.

Do you think getting 11k euros per year into the blocked account can help me keep myself sustained for the year? I can work part time when I am short of money. Do you have a video that talks about the requirements and stuff regarding universities? Germany is very tempting for me cuz I heard it's great to get hands on knowledge on cyber security.

A relative of mine, who is an Assistant Professor in the Astrophysics Department at IISc Bangalore, suggested that completing a Bachelor's degree in India could be a more practical option, particularly from a financial perspective. He mentioned that this approach may allow me to save money during the undergraduate years and later pursue Master's and PhD studies abroad, where European countries are generally considered to offer better opportunities in terms of research, infrastructure, and academic environment.

This info will be very helpful for those coming from India. I wanted to share my thoughts on one of the topics you covered—Racism. I moved to the U.S. from India 18 years ago and have been working in IT. I agree with you that videos about India—street food, trains, and similar topics—have always been around. We cannot change how some people, influenced by such content, may exhibit racism. It does hurt, but it’s best to ignore. In fact, things are much better now compared to a few years ago, though there are more anti India forces spreading these videos much larger scale. Even after proving ourselves as a model minority of 5 million in the U.S.—top earners, with children excelling in every field—some still choose to focus on a few outdated clips from back home to make fun.

I believe that once I start living in Germany, it will become easier to improve my language skills.  If I come to pursue an MBA degree, will I be allowed to do part-time work during my studies? Specifically, are there opportunities for students to work in the IT sector while studying?  Are part-time jobs generally available for students from India? I think having one would make it easier for me to manage my budget.  Could you please explain these points in brief?  Thank you.",2025-10-05T12:05:08Z,4

Unlike the US, UK, and other countries where students often stay and work permanently, this is not typically the case in Germany. While it's possible to find lower-level jobs that don't match your qualifications simply because you're fluent in German, this isn't a sustainable long-term strategy. High taxes and living costs mean that you probably won't become wealthy; instead, you'll live an average life. Additionally, there's intense competition, and employers tend to favor native Germans over migrants.   German employers also usually prefer candidates from prestigious US and British universities like Yale or Cambridge over student immigrants with a university degree from Germany. This is a fact. They often welcome international students primarily for economic reasons, not necessarily to provide more employment opportunities. I know an American who studied here,  became fluent in German (C1 level), speaking almost like a native, but she told me most employers rejected her in favor of native Germans. She eventually returned to the US.   So, believing that studying in Germany will guarantee a job afterward is an illusion. There are already highly qualified refugees from other countries who are unemployed here. Many YouTube channels don't have a thorough understanding of the German system; while some are relatively trustworthy, they still lack complete knowledge and experience. Comparatively, this YouTube is genuine, although the guy didn't cover some other facts, which I can understand may be due to a lack of knowledge of the German system.",2025-08-27T09:32:15Z,16

Learn to read write and speak impeccable English language. 2. Look into the career page of software companies in USA. 3. Learn the skills which are mentioned in those job postings. It would take you more than 7 years to master those skills. Do not go to any school or college in India. 4. Try to become internationally known professional on your area of expertise. Try to help the professionals working in the developed countries on your area of expertise. Impress them with your skills. They would hire you.

The IT sector plummeted in 2024/2025, with most jobs being ghost listings. 100% remote is rare unless it’s a foreign company with a German branch. Local firms demand fluent German and in-office presence, often 3 days/week. Big cities offer slightly higher pay, but cost of living kills your net income. If you have a 3h commute - your problem, unpaid. Certs? Mostly on your own time and dime. Customers want to outsource responsibility, not collaborate, while MSSPs overpromise services they can’t deliver. If you’re OK earning 10–15k less than you're worth, Germany’s IT sector is waiting. Otherwise, consider Austria or Switzerland. Also, if you're single, expect 38–40% of your 40–65k yearly gross salary to vanish through taxes and insurance. You're also expected to already know everything - onboarding is just a theoretical concept.",2025-09-26T21:57:04Z,43

Salaries in EU are kind of fixed no matter the company you will earn mostly the same in regards on your role level. Second mistake is to think english is enough to work in any country this is very wrong and that applies not only to Germany but all other EU countries. If you really want to thrive in a non-english speaking country you will need to have at least C1 level. Third mistake is to think in terms of amount and not purchasing power and cost of living in regards of salaries. I lived in Dusseldorf and currenlty living in Spain. f.i. earning 65k in Spain has the same purchasing power as earning 85k in Germany. This is a very common mistake people do. I prefer Spain over Germany 1000% but I have the advantage that I speak Spanish and German fluently so I can choose. Europe is the best option if you are looking for a good life and very good work-life balance plus job labor laws that protects you from the company bs. if you are looking to work 24/7 because you are an entreprenur with the shark mindset and want to own your company and be able to abuse the system because you have a lot of money then move to the US evil corp system.,2025-09-19T13:31:36Z,99

What I’ve also noticed with my apprentices is that a few years ago, anyone who could more or less spell “IT” could get a junior position. The situation today is completely different. The economy is struggling, resulting in fewer junior openings, and when such positions do appear, they often come with very poor salaries.  Overall, Germany simply isn’t an attractive place for securing high-salary IT positions. Anything in the 100k+ range is extremely rare, and the taxes (more precisely: social contributions) are very high, at least for employees.  At present, I do not expect the situation to improve.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with Bachelor's degree in CS and 12+ years of experience living in Germany and after being laid off early this year I am not able to find a job in any city for 4 months now. There are offices of Google, Microsoft and other big tech companies yes, but all of them except Amazon are barely hiring here. Other international tech companies like Salesforce, IBM, Oracle, Snowflake, Datadog, Hubspot are not hiring here at all. When it comes to salaries, somehow being a senior I ended up earning the same amount as the upper boundary of an early career software developer's salary you named. I've been asking more, but some recruiters straight out say that they are targeting for far less, since the SWE job market here is severely oversaturated. One of the recruiters told me that the job opening I applied for got 300+ applications. Please do your research more deeply next time",2025-07-17T18:09:55Z,126

Germany is currently making the most ridiculous moves possible, despite high unemployment, and you're spreading it.  With these courses/bootcamps/ etc., you can become simple programmers, not engineers. And the reason they do this is because there are so many new training centers using the budget allocated by the employment agency. They'll claim to teach you something every six months, but in reality, you'll just become cheap labor. Then you'll try to find a job, failing to provide the necessary qualifications and causing employers to charge engineers less.  There's a major and deep-seated problem, and such suggestions are nothing but nonsense and lining others' pockets. Get a grip and actually try to learn something!",2025-07-23T17:56:18Z,36

For student visa he takes 1 lakh and opportunity card 1.5 lakh. He himself was unsuccessful and scamming people by sending them to Germany. Knowing very well there are no jobs.

Many private universities in India prey on students with high fees. If you're in IT, there's a small chance, only if you speak fluent German. The truth is this: Germany has a huge aging population, and it needs immigrants to help fund the pension system for these old people, so it needs your taxes to fund the system. They already have a high number of refugees here who are paid via social contributions.  You'll see many of the menial jobs here and done mainly by Indians who can't find other jobs, so yes, if you want to come here to do a small job, earn a few lakhs, and then go nowhere in life, then it's not a bad place.",2025-12-18T16:35:51Z,0

The comparison between India and Germany for unemployment is not accurate. One is because both are percentage and hence doesnt depend on the size of population. Second, the true unemployment rate in India cannot be measured because of unorganized labour and underemployed labour which constitutes more than 70% of indian economy.  2. You mentioned ""most of the employees getting laid off"" are expats or foreigners - is there any data to back this up? I am not fully sure why this would be the case and find no reason for companies here to selectively choose foreigners and fire them.  3. In terms of automotive companies laying off people, its only half the picture what you stated. For example, VW decided to layoff 5000 employees by 2027. However, because labour unions are strong, the way ""layoff"" happens is by identifying people nearing retirement (arnd 65) and asking them to quit before ""unofficial"" retirment age of 67 in exchange of an year's salary. In a way this is layoff, but really different from what happens in other parts. In companies with strong labour unions, despite the news of layoffs, in reality most layoffs are ""voluntary"" in nature in exchange of almost 6-8 months of salary in addition to the unemployment benefit of 60% wage they would receive.  All other points mentioned are correct",2025-04-04T06:47:50Z,17
