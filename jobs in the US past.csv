A lot is due to the culture of hierarchy & saving 'face'. For example, we were told never to leave the office before your boss. A bit of an issue when you finished your work by 4pm and your boss is still there till 10pm! You have to find ways to occupy yourselves for those 6 hours. So on paper I worked a 14 hour day but in reality there was maybe only a few hours of actual productive stuff done.   Another thing was endless meetings, worse than anything I've seen in the US or UK. And meetings are rarely productive due to the face saving aspect - it's generally bad etiquette to disagree strongly with someone in a meeting in front of others even if their ideas are terrible.  The average Japanese salaryman also drinks extremely heavily. We would typically go out for dinner with our team 4 nights per week & we'd all get drunk - so most days a significant amount of staff are nursing hangovers. Again due to the hierarchy culture you can't really say no if your boss invites you out for dinner, which ends up being almost every night.   It's really not a surprise to see Japan's productivity levels plummet over the past decades.",2023-09-24T00:40:40Z,635

Fear, shame and guilt are all the fundamental aspects of Japanese society. They feel guilty for taking a paid vacation because they know that their colleagues would be working and they are fearful that the whole company would be resentful of that one individual that chooses to take the day off or leave work early. They are not actually working to finish work, they work to create more work so they don't ever have to finish working.

According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, all across the country, teachers pay a financial penalty to serve the public mission of educating our kids instead of entering more lucrative professions. In my state that penalty is 16 cents to every dollar. When benchmarked with median household income, teachers in my state make the 9th lowest salary in the nation. Combined with the fact that we have the lowest teacher working conditions in the country, and that budgets are still being cut left and right, class sizes increasing, 30+ teaching positions being eliminated, it's no wonder that they're outsourcing these jobs to the lowest bidder. When the most important in-school factor in a child's education is the quality of teaching they receive, why would you put a larger focus on money than on the future of your country?",2019-12-25T03:30:20Z,145

The Army is weird, Marines don’t give a Fuck and the Navy likes their decks buffed and bright work brasso. If you go into this rate or have been an HM you will understand. Making rate is hard except during war cause lots of Corpsmen think their John Wayne. So the more that get killed the better the chance for promotion. I know that is morbid. But that is just the way it is. Just a piece of advice. Teach your Marines “Buddy Aide.”  That will keep you alive. You take care of the grunts, they will die for you. Good luck.

These can be made from various materials, including rubberized asphalt, EPDM rubber, or TPO, and are designed to create a flexible, seamless, and waterproof barrier that helps to prevent water penetration. It's important to note that membrane rolls of EPDM liner can be quite heavy and may require special shipping and handling arrangements for some individuals; For example, a 20x25 foot (500 sq ft) 45 mil liner can weigh 150 lbs, requiring freight shipping.   I often seen very short Mexicans carry two rolls of membranes on one trip if the ladder is at the right angle.",2025-07-17T22:08:04Z,0

We gave them preferential trading partner status. We waived taxes and shipping costs and tariffs and made it virtually free for China to grow their economy. We got China in to the WTO providing the enormous gains in China's economy and GDP in the last 10 years or so. Now that China has achieved front-runner status, China can compete on the same level playing field as the rest of the world. Only China thinks that they don't have to abide by the rules anymore.

I can't understand why we here think we can go it alone. I agree the U.S is a large part of the world economy at 25%, but that means the rest of the world is 75%. Together they could do real harm to us and we are taunting them to just try it. I never hear anyone here in this country stating what possible barriers we throw up to other economies. I am sure there are many as well. China is the real adversary regarding world trade with oversupply of products of all kinds. The American politicians have decided to fight them alone as well instead of digging in with our allies. Even the thought of Trumps future actions has forced our allies to look for tariff free areas to get and sell their wares. Canada is going so far as to create a new pipeline to the west coast because they don't trust the U.S regarding the purchase of their oil.I don't blame them as the U.S has shown it will not respect any agreement already in place with nations friend or foe. I guess this it what some of us Americans think ""draining the swamp and make American great again"" is all about. What a sad and obvious mistake. Lastly, any crumbs of missed opportunity we leave behind will be gladly picked up by other nations and we will one day find ourselves wondering what happened to us.",2018-06-04T15:42:04Z,20

Businesses got 14% tax cuts.  profits have doubled for many companies, the costs of steel and aluminum only goes up 25%  say from 50cents per pound to 62 cents...  100lbs is 5.00 to 6.20.  labor, energy used, tools, related supplies are bundled into net price per unit.  If say product at 100lbs used x labor/tools/shipping costs=$100 a company often is suggested to sell at double to profit if not more meaning $200-$500 for product.  tax cut 14% is $28-$70 which is much greater than the cost of just the metals alone.  Generally labor costs more, shipping, tools, energy make up much greater percentage than just the raw materials.  Lets say 1lb of steel is $1. costs arent that high though.  Take the half ton truck segment, highly profitable vehicles.  most weight is around 6000lbs or $6000 if 1.00 per pound, 25cents is an increase of 1500.  so now 7500.  Considering trucks start at 30,000 a tax cut on 30,000 of 14%= $4200        mind you steel is not that high per pound yet so the tax cut still helped more even with new tariffs.  To answer as trump supporter yes Im happy.  My company has doubled profits with tax cuts, and we use steel and aluminum and other metals.  A small price hike does nothing to stop the raises or bonuses regardless how they want to spin the news.",2018-06-03T18:39:43Z,0
