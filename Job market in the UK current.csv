Interesting I learned how to code and do stuff like pivot tables and work in Quickbooks. However also earned another degree with my CS one which was Philosophy. Many view it as stupid, but was very fun/easy to understand while many couldn't do the critical Philosophy classes. I thought as a kid, ""getting/doing Computer Science/IT will help A LOT for my future"", looks like that's not the case. The job market sucks and cannot find a job. My 20s passed with a ok job but let go due to company layoffs and now in early 30s and cannot get a single job. I want to work. I'm bored staying at home.

The easiest one they found recently, is to slowly cut down on employment because they only want the bare minimum level of employees, just enough to make the product work.  Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.  I hate the stigma on both ends.

One small correction. Millionaires are NOT ""leaving in record numbers"". As Private Eye pointed out, the report was based on a model, based on a sample of data from Linked In and the Sunday Times Rich List. Now, ignoring the fact that many businesses close each year (meaning these people are often no longer millionaires, on paper). The report also ignored the number of new millionaires that were created that year.  Not even HMRC (UK tax collection authority) knows how many millionaires we have, as they measure income, not wealth (they are, however, apparently ""working on this"").  Many millionaires are shy about announcing their wealth in the press. The ones who have left, on the other hand, have been very noisy about it.   So what is the true picture? ""Of the more than 3 million millionaires in the UK, just 9,500 were reported to be leaving the country in 2024 - just 0.3% of the millionaire population."" London Economic Forum. It turns out that many patriotic millionaires still enjoy the lifestyle, quality of fee-paying schools, friendships, and relative safety that they have in the UK, and are staying firmly put.

Other former colonial powers such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Portugal quickly adjusted to their reduced status and concentrated on building wealth for their citizens. The UK still thinks it is a world power with a Navy that can't put to sea without American logistical support, a nuclear deterrent which again needs American technical knowledge, two brand new aircraft carriers that will be as useful as a underwater hair dryer in a modern conflict. State education has failed a generation of children, the justice system is failing the victims of crime, it has the worst police force in Western Europe that is riddled with corruption. As a UK citizen I would prefer it if our governing class stopped deluding themselves into thinking they are still a major player on the world stage, they are not and can barely keep their own house in order. All its efforts should be concentrated on stamping out corruption at home and stopping London from being the money laundering capital of the world. I look in envy at the low levels of corruption in the public institutions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden; whilst in the UK , former Army Generals; pumped up with their own self importance; talk of going to war with Russia and increasing defence spending.

The harsh reality we've been dealing with for 40 years is that ""trickle down economics"" is a myth. Quality of life for average people and overly favorable concessions for the rich are in fact, mutually exclusive. No matter how much you cater to the needs of well-to-do finance bros and billionaires the average person is never going to achieve lower rent, cheaper food, better public transportation, higher quality of life AND lower cost of living all while keeping taxes for the wealthy low to non-existant. It just doesn't work that way. The billionaire class are parasites who act like they provide so much to the economy but it's only the section of the economy that keeps them rich and makes them richer. Need a couple hundred thousand for a community park or affordable housing or walkable neighborhoods? Nah how about we get a couple hundred million for a new data center to train AI so we don't have to provide jobs to the unwashed masses anymore.

Aim to have enough, not excess. Learn to be content, not grinding. You will find happiness moment to moment, not in large clumps.

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment. Because in these jobs failure is not hard, but ""only"" results in a less satisfying customer experience, instead of a total production or process failure.",2025-08-13T18:22:00Z,915

One of the worst unemployment rates in the EU, both overall and youth employment. If you don't have years of experience, you're already in a bad place. And because of the unemployment benefits, some jobs aren't even that beneficial, you'd get the same amount of money if you worked or not. And this is coming from a point of view of an automation technician graduate and now working in the forestry industry. Even the idea of losing my job is scary enough, because finding a new workplace seems like a distant dream more than anything.",2025-08-13T22:18:53Z,22

It suck’s to graduate into an economic downturn, but economic booms/busts in the U.S. are normal and survivable. I graduated in the 90s when companies were big into “downsizing,” meaning new grads had to compete with a ton of young workers with experience who just got laid off.  No one wanted the new grads when they had 50 young but proven workers with experience  lining up for the few jobs hiring.  My colleges job fair was almost cancelled as no employers came, and in my dorm, seniors would post their many job  rejection letters outside their door.   But…..we all got thru it.  Some rode the downturn out in grad school and became doctors or lawyers.  Some joined the military.  Some went home and worked what jobs they could until the next boom cycle.

Writing seems a useless and an unimportant skill, but this is a powerful skill in the Digital Marketing field. Even if you use AI to write, you still need extreme creativity, human-intelligence, and tech skills to be able to give the right commands, and use AI as a tool to make your work unique and engaging from the rest.

This makes things incredibly difficult with time differences and work culture differences it’s not feasible to expect our deli hub members to produce the same output as our London based team members.

So this was already a huge problem, and the inclusion of foreign contractors in countries with significantly lower costs of living changes it, but doesn’t _dramatically_ change it. It’s an acceleration, not an inflection point.   Which doesn’t mean that it’s not bad or not worth talking about. And the acceleration can make a thing that was a minor problem around the edges into a society-undermining problem. But most humans are very bad at recognizing creeping threats, very bad at planning for nebulous threats, and bad-to-very-bad at cognitive empathy. So I think the lack of conversation reflects lack of recognizing that this is a systemic problem. Thanks for bringing it up!  But I also think this reflects factionalism and lack of much trans-national worker solidarity to counterbalance the power of transnational corporations. In the US, big transnational corporations and some politicians have for 50+ years mostly succeeded in scapegoating workers in lower-COL countries and pitting US workers against them. Most of the US unions completely fell for this in the 1970s-1990s, pushing to prevent offshoring of manufacturing jobs through contracts and legislation, instead of pushing to unionize the foreign workers. They saw foreign workers as unfair  competition instead of recognizing the corporations and shareholders as the source of the problem.",2025-08-17T20:28:24Z,33

Very bright polite and when we got him talking he was on his 127th application for a job could not pay his rent and his girlfriend had broke up with him as a result. He could just afford a tea . Lots of young people struggling in a parallel universe living on near war time rations - and nowhere to go for help. If you see a similar young person buy them a coffee and a bite to eat. He was close to a breakdown and given our explosion in bio medical and drug treatment portfolios could have ended up on a path of no return in the 'here to help' psychiatric lane  of life. Leave a free coffee or money for a bun if you can. It buys them warmth and a wifi connection to continue their job search .❤,2025-11-30T06:32:05Z,78

Right before you had labour jobs like warehouse workers and carpenters wanting an associates or minimum 2yrs of experiene, straining job qualifications on the path to skilled labour. During and after the recession you had skilled qualifications wanting experience in things that either had nothing to do with the job, demanding multiple level experience for a single position, and/or experience in things that hadn't hit the market yet. So more work and more demands were placed on the average person often with less pay, while tuition prices were climbing, forcing many graduates to change fields just to afford predatory loans.   That sets the stage for where we are now, never actually fixing the primary issues but building upon them. Employers keep looking for ways to save money at the expense of cutting labour, but not really doing anything to develop and expand the company that would protect it from its own unsustainable bad habits. Unfortunately ai isn't going to be able to deliver on its promises and companies, rather that hire back it's workers, are just going to accept the lower quality of the product as the new standard, while keeping the price the same, then raising it once ppl get used to it.   At some point we are going to have ai news, answering services, and even podcasts where there's no real person doing anything other than writing the script. We already have judges and lawyers using AI to file and interpret cases, and researchers using it to submit their research,and it's only a matter of time before we have laws based on nothing, and research that kills ppl based on a fever dream.

Thats because there dumb and haven't prepared a sufficient CV for the recruiting company in their college.   My case I cracked 20LPA package from Dshaw. Working for past 2 yrs about to switch companies aboard. So it isn't about which institution you're doing from. You must have skills and lot of projects prepared in your CV, obviously you also need to know which companies come to that college.   IIMs have sliver lining that you will get a decent package even if you don't try hard as someone from tier 2. But in the long run the harder worker will get more opportunities than IIMs in my experience just because your CV is way more detailed and seasoned compared to their only complishment being couple coursera and IIM recognized degree.",2025-08-21T16:11:33Z,15

You’re not looking at the big picture or fully considering cause and effect. Right now, the economy is already teetering on a major downshift. It’s a complex issue, but when you combine inflation, rising unemployment, and stagnant wages, you end up with an economy that stalls out.  The real concern is how governments respond when that happens. History offers warnings, just look at the Great Depression. My grandfather lived through it. He ran a grocery store and bought inventory through an associated distributor. His business didn’t fail due to mismanagement; it failed because his customers had no money, even for basic groceries. The entire economy halted, dead stop.   People ended up relying on soup kitchens and charity, many homeless. If you think financial security will shield you from systemic collapse, you’re not seeing the full picture.   If AI takes out employment or even disrupts employment to the extent you mentioned then the you are in another great depression era where you will be in just as much peril as everyone.

And I feel like everything I was ever told growing up when it comes to how to be a good adult just doesn’t apply anymore. I don’t know what things to prioritize or care about. Is it money? Is it my dreams? Is it my country? Should I go off grid and hide in a cabin the rest of my life? Is it smart to bring a family into this world 10-15 years from now? Is it worth caring about health or is that just a lost cause? Sorry if this seems dramatic. I really am just so lost and confused. I feel like half of the people I know say things based on the past and the other half says things based on their guess about the future. I just want a hug man😭😭😭,2025-12-06T09:07:54Z,9

Starting with the great decoupling in the 1970s, human labor has been and will continue trending to zero. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY. Automation and robotics will necessarily replace human workers due to the current economic system. Think about this-today, AI is the WORST it will ever be going forward. It DOESN'T MATTER if AI ""creates"" 200 million new jobs...AI will solve and execute these new ""jobs"" much faster than humans will be able to adapt, learn, and fill them. Capital/employee model-it worked great...for quite a while. However, now companies that automate lower their costs, become more competitive. Those that keep higher-cost human labor necessarily fall behind and will go out of business. This creates a system where replacing people with machines is not just likely, but necessary for company survival. There is a way to deal with this humanely, but it would require a full revamp of the social contract and our concept of work. Even capitalists will want this change when unemployment reaches a tipping point and there’s no one left with money to buy the crap they’re selling.  I wrote a paper in 2014 and the progression is right about where I thought it would be. The paper ""The End of Work as We Know It"" explored how rapid advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, and automation are fundamentally reshaping the nature of work and the global economy. I argued that, unlike past technological revolutions, modern AI-driven changes threaten to eliminate not just manual or repetitive jobs but also many roles traditionally considered safe, including those requiring creativity, analysis, or interpersonal skills. As machines become increasingly capable, the need for human labor in many sectors will evaporate, leading to widespread job displacement and a potential crisis of purpose and income for millions. The paper discussed how this transition challenges traditional economic and social structures, including the link between work and personal identity, as well as the mechanisms by which people earn a living. I suggested that society must adapt by rethinking education, social safety nets, and the concept of work itself, potentially embracing Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a TRANSITORY STOPGAP or other models that decouple survival from employment. NOTE: UBI is not the end goal, but just a transitioning tool. The paper called for proactive planning and open dialogue to ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared and that individuals can find meaning and security in a post-work world. Unfortunately, not unsurprisingly, Humanity has totally botched it up to this point.  Reasoning AI Is the Next Big Leap. The future of AI is not just about generating answers, but about “reasoning” breaking down complex problems step-by-step, more like a human brain. Breakthroughs like DeepSeek’s open-source reasoning models are already being incorporated into platforms like GPT and xAI, marking a shift toward more advanced, thoughtful AI. Think EXPONENTIALLY, not LINEARLY.  There’s a persistent and misleading narrative circulating often perpetuated by short term goal-driven institutions like politicians, universities, and tech company executives, that the future of work is secure. The claim goes: “You just need to learn how to work with AI,” and humans collaborating with AI will outperform either one alone. But recent research, including a landmark study from the University of Virginia, tells a different story. In diagnosing medical conditions, AI alone achieved far greater accuracy than either human doctors or even doctors assisted by AI. The median diagnostic accuracy for the docs using Chat GPT Plus was 76.3%, while the results for the physicians using conventional approaches was 73.7%. Sounds like “a win” at first. However, Chat GPT Plus alone achieved a median diagnostic accuracy of more than 92%. In other words, the comforting idea that humans will always be essential partners to machines is crumbling. In many fields, AI is not just a tool, it is the superior performer. This has staggering implications for the future of work, especially to the often used solution of prior technological displacement that go “You just need to be retrained.” To the group advocating the ""retraining solution,"" I pose to you this: You have a medical doctor, just finished 8 years of higher education, a low-paid 4-year internship/residency, is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and just got outperformed by automation; what would you have this doctor retrained into that will offer a secure job?  The result of this, since the United States' moronic system is based on taxing employees for about 70% of all tax revenue, this will further exacerbate the problem. Tax needs to be based on what's going on now and in the future not what worked 75 years ago. Oh I know it's so evil to think, but we might need to tax the companies who are doing the automation. Even if you do that, it's a win-win. For instance say a company had 1,000 employees in automated away down to 100. 1,000 employees paid federal taxes, including payroll tax, of about 20 million a year. Now the 100 people pay about 2 million a year. However, by automating, the company sees two things: they are no longer paying approximately 60 million in wages and their share of payroll tax, AND since nobody automates to lose money they also have higher profits. What's so wrong about taxing that company for the $60 million dollars they don't have to pay anymore and a fair percentage of their additional profits they now make through the automation. Not all the additional profits, but some of them. If you do that there's a higher tax revenue and more profits for the company. That's a win-win for the government and for businesses. If humanity, as a whole, weren't so stupid, we would just adjust as tech progresses to where EVERYONE benefits somewhat from each stage and just move smoothly into the post-labor economy.  To understand this shift, consider the historical role of the horse and oxen. They were once essential to the economy as sources of power for agriculture, transport, and industry. Technologies like the horse collar and the steel plow dramatically increased their output, making them even more valuable. But then came the steam engine and, later, the internal combustion engine. These machines didn’t just help the horse, but outperformed it entirely. Trains, tractors, and trucks could do the job ten, even a hundred times faster and more powerfully. And from that moment forward, the horse was no longer critical to economic output. It was, in essence, unemployed.  This is what AI and robotics are doing to human labor. They are not simply replacing the repetitive or the physical; they are increasingly outperforming humans in cognition, strategy, design, and communication. And just like the horse, our value in the economic system will diminish, not from lack of talent or effort, but because machines will do the job better. That’s why we need to start thinking not in terms of retraining, but about restructuring society itself for a world where human labor is no longer essential to production. When the very essence of what makes an entity useful to the current economy is superseded (be that strength, endurance, dexterity, analysis, creativity, empathy, intelligence, persuasion as well as many other qualities) that entity becomes irrelevant to economic output.  Potential solution. Decentralized AI Ownership: A Bridge Toward Post-Scarcity. While Universal Basic Income (UBI) may serve as an initial economic stopgap, bridging today’s economy with tomorrow’s abundance consider an even more equitable and long-term solution: Decentralizing the ownership of artificial intelligence itself.   Rather than concentrating the power of AI in the hands of a few corporations or governments, envision a model where AI entities are open-source and collectively owned. This could take the form of assigning each person a digital ""share"" of an AI system, not unlike a stakeholder’s share in a company. As the AI produces value, whether through intellectual labor, creative output, or autonomous economic participation, those shares would generate dividends distributed directly to individuals.   This model would ensure that as AI becomes the dominant productive force in society, the wealth it creates is shared universally, not monopolized. It aligns with the principle that the fruits of public knowledge made possible by centuries of human collaboration should benefit everyone, not just a few early adopters or private entities. In practice, this could look like:   - AI systems running Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that distribute profits algorithmically. - Smart contracts ensuring transparent, equitable income flows based on collective stake. - Global “AI cooperatives” where users vote on how AI is used, improved, and deployed. - Universal basic compute.   If AI becomes the primary driver of economic output, then equitable access to its benefits isn’t just fair, it’s necessary to avoid deepening inequality and instability. It provides a scalable, technologically aligned extension to UBI, ensuring people not only have income, but true economic participation in the age of intelligent machines.   Ultimately, decentralized AI ownership may be the last transition phase before full post-scarcity, when advanced technologies like universal nanofactories or matter compilers render even economic structures obsolete. Until then, however, models like this offer a way to reclaim agency in a world where production no longer requires human hands, and where wealth can, for the first time in history, truly be universal.",2025-09-22T17:02:27Z,43

Executives handed themselves bonuses with public money while the public paid the price. Occupy Wall Street tried to push back, but nothing truly changed. The same players stayed in power. The rules stayed rigged.  Now we are living through the next phase. Mass layoffs, ghost jobs, AI filters, and stagnant wages are everywhere. Profits soar, shareholders celebrate, and executives cash out while telling workers to be grateful for scraps.  Meritocracy is gone. Optics replaced it. Corporate success is no longer built on value or skill, but on who can perform the best image while cutting the people they parade for PR. Behind the curtain, the human element is gone, and the façade grows thicker.  AI is not the enemy. The real danger is AI CEOs and executives who treat technology as their personal crown. They are not building; they are competing to out-narcissist each other, blinded by ego and greed. Investors fuel this arms race because it spikes their portfolios, no matter the long-term damage. Behind closed doors, the C-suite and shareholders pat themselves on the back while carving out what remains of the middle class.  This is not about politics. It is about power. The ultra-wealthy control the levers and have no interest in building a system that works for anyone else. This is the second reckoning. The first was the manufacturing carve-out that gutted entire communities. This one is a technological carve-out, and its effects are already eroding the workforce from within.  If you feel invisible, you are not imagining it. This market is not broken; it is built to extract and discard. Until people stop accepting optics for progress and demand substance, the machine will keep grinding through generation after generation.  The ultra-wealthy will not save us.

I went back to get my Masters after 3 years experience in pathology (hospital laboratory). My degree was in Biomedical Science and I graduated in 2018, prior to my Master degree I was teaching for a couple of years (never again), yes it’s that bad!  Anyway, I knew I would need my Masters at one point or another so I went back to get it and specialised in Clinical Biochemistry.  In the 3 month gap between when I graduated and my final interview (March), I applied for around 30 jobs (including areas I had no experience in such as micro and haematology) and got the following interviews;  1. Interview as an Associate Practitioner (AP) in about 4 jobs (was my previous job before leaving). 2. An interview as a Medical Laboratory Assistant in two of them (including one in micro which required no experience but someone beat me). 3. Two interviews as a trainee Biomedical Scientist (one in virology and one in clinical chemistry).  Note, having the Biomedical Science degree itself is not enough to be a Biomedical Scientist. You also need to do a portfolio which grants you membership to the Health and Care Professions Council.  Anyway, back on topic. Even after attending said interviews (averaging 1 every 10 days) I got accepted for the best job I could have (the trainee post in chemistry) which was ironically the best paid job I’d applied for but it required me to move from home as it’s the best experience I could ask for.

But they didn't, as soon as they lost 'graduate' status, they moved on. And the simple reason for that was that they didn't move salaries up enough while we were graduates, so salaries stagnated in highly skilled jobs, and we could see roles for up to double our salaries going on the outside. So I imagine a lot of grad roles have disappeared because companies didn't think they were getting a benefit out of it (staff retention), when in that all they had to do was be a little more proactive on internal progression/salary rises.",2025-07-14T14:31:02Z,2

Despite ...,2025-11-15T00:21:37Z,@gwgux,"When a company wants 3-5 years of experience for an entry level job: 1. They aren't actually hiring. They're posting jobs pad the ""jobs created"" numbers. They're going to use it as leverage to say ""they can't find qualified people"" and pressure the government to allow them to hire more non-citizens on visa for cheaper (ex: the H1B visa program). OR, they're going to use it as an excuse for diving more into automation to justify replacing those jobs with AI and make someone at the company look good by ""solving a problem"" with AI.  2. They don't want people fresh out of school. You've all probably seen the BS reasons given for this. Look it up if you haven't, but there are companies that don't want to hire Gen Z workers fresh out of school right now. They often won't come out and say it because they don't want to spend money handling the backlash, but it's essentially what they're doing. As a reminder, age discrimination is LEGAL for anybody under 40. It's not until you hit age 40 and above that you now have a legal right against age discrimination in the US.  3. They're keeping wages down. Someone with 3-5 years of work experience is worth more than an entry level job salary, but if they can't get a higher position somewhere, they'll have to take the lower paying ""entry level"" position even if the ""other duties as assigned"" aspect of the job is actually something that would normally be done at a higher position. The reason why this is significant is because wages DO get tracked. Companies look at that data and think about ways they can squeeze more work out of every individual and if they can spread some work normally done by someone in a higher position among entry level workers to ""give them experience"" while keeping the amount they pay to get that work done lower, they consider it as ""win/win"". The bright eyed, eager entry level worker gets more exposure and experience and the company gets to pay less to get the work done. Now they can use AI to take more of the work load as well.  This isn't anything new. The same thing happened in the fallout of the dotcom bubble bust in the early 2000s. Younger GenX and older Millenials went through the same thing. Even before AI, people were writing software for automation. It IS unfair. It ruined those people's lives and prevented them from having a good start after school. Millions of people were screwed just by the timing of them entering the workforce. There was NO help for them. There will be NO help for GenZ entering the workforce today. In addition to that millions of other older workers had their careers destroyed as well. It was a dark time and then just as things showed signs of getting better, the Great Recession happened in the late 2000s.  Today, we're also heading to a major recession. It's a VERY bad sign when AI spending from few companies is literally propping up the US economy right now. The writing is on the wall. This situation may improve somewhat for a few people who finally break into the workforce, but a recession is coming to knock them and everyone else down.  I REALLY wish there was a better outlook coming, but there isn't. All any of us can do (young and older workers alike) is keep on trying. Giving up won't pay the bills or put food on the table. After we get through the coming dark times, things will eventually get better for everyone, but we have to keep trying and sometimes fight to get there.",2025-11-16T17:27:49Z,20

Yes, companies are reporting record profits while job growth is stagnant — but the real issue goes deeper. With real-time analytics and constant quarterly-report pressure, executives are fixated on hitting KPIs every 90 days instead of building anything long-term.  So the “strategy” becomes layoffs, cost-cutting, and efficiency pushes — because that’s the only reliable way to churn higher profits. They’re not generating those profits through innovation or sustained growth; they’re squeezing the organization to make the numbers look good.  And now that AI can replace a lot of lower-level work, I don’t know if this cycle ever reverses. We’ve identified the problem, but I’m not convinced the old job market ever comes back.",2025-11-18T22:30:17Z,4

The federal government has purposefully crashed the economy to forestall entitlement reforms, tax reform, immigration reform, and industrial policy reform. Any reforms would risk uprooting entrenched financial positions so they’re crashing the economy instead. AI should be a boon for productivity but that can only happen during economic growth periods. So that’s why the AI is fundamentally useless. AI allows people to do more work to less knowledge, but when the government increases inflation by printing money while simultaneously making it more and more expensive to hire and import, we get an economic crash instead of an uptick in quality of life. By the end of 2028 there will be a full blown economic depression similar to 2008, or perhaps even worse.",2025-10-02T22:40:01Z,13

Even at minimum wage, I had management riding me nonstop to be faster every night I worked.  This was a minimum wage job, yet they treated it like Amazon warehouse where they keep pushing you every day you work to be faster and do more in less time.  I was written up for the dumbest stuff.  One night I was stocking I had 4 mixed pallets on one end of my aisle and 1 pallet of just my stuff at the other.  Management called me to the office and said they're writing me up for not working because that 1 pallet is still sitting there at the end of my aisle.  I explained he obviously didn't see the other 4 mixed pallets which my stuff on top buried everyone else's stuff underneath so I was trying to move that off and stock it because you're not supposed to leave boxes strewn across the floor.  Management said they didn't see it and apologized, but said they still had to write me up because they had already called me to the office and it would look bad on them for pulling me away from my work for nothing.  That was back in 2015.  I'm sure Walmart is a lot harder today.  I changed jobs went to a grocery store doing minimum wage.  The grocery store refused to provide benefits, so everyone was scheduled less than 20hrs/wk.  I had just graduated from college (in my 30s) and had 10 years of customer service/retail exp under my belt and they treat me like I'm below the high school kids they were hiring that sit around drinking gatorade and playing on their phones.  Anyway, minimum wage jobs for the past 10 years couldn't afford an apartment, and I'm sure nowadays they can't either.  My old apartment up near the university was across the street from the grocery store used to be $600/month.  Today, it's practically doubled in rent, and the neighborhood now has a lot of problems with drugs.  A nice apartment in that university town you're looking at paying $3k+ for a single.  I left to China in 2019 because I couldn't find a job with my BA degree from the university right there in that town.  The Career Center at the university kept telling me to apply for GEICO insurance because they just opened new offices and needed help.  Her husband worked there.  I applied and went through round 1 of interviews 3 times.  They always ghost me after that.  So one day I called GEICO and asked to speak with the HR because I really wanted to know yes or no whether I got the job.  They told me the HR will be working on Thursdays.  I called back on Thursday, and the HR was out of town down in Florida on a family vacation.  I'm sitting there like, ""you could have told me she was going to be out of the office this thursday, call back next thursday, but you didn't.""  Felt like they just were making up stories and the job postings on Indeed might have been fake to appear like they're hiring when they were not.  I was also upset with the career center for not helping me find work.  You would think the school would be helping graduates find work because it'd show that their university degrees actually have value!  Instead, they didn't help me.  I had to go out and find my own job teaching in China.  I wish I could end there, but covid started 6 months after I arrived.  Their visa situation was chaos and my visa expired during a lockdown, so I couldn't get another work visa and I had to return home.  Now I'm jobless, living at home, taking care of my grandmother that was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  If she goes into a nursing home, we'll lose the house.  I've tried finding work when I came home from China, but employers just laugh me out the door.  The only type of job hiring right now is heavy industrial, and I don't have any heavy industrial skills.  I'm an academic, not a tradesman.  You say the job market is on the edge?  I'd say it's already collapsed when even young generation are struggling to find entry level positions and salaries everywhere are not keeping up with inflation and the rising cost of living.",2025-09-02T05:00:45Z,93

Its disheartening to say the least, and I'm sticking to it till I have just enough money to leave this train wreck of a country. I'm aware the situation isn't much better abroad but ill take my chances since I've not been offered anything better here and the situation isn't looking likely to change for the new few years. I live in the north of England and its dire, most people I know either cant find even a basic job generally or have also ditched getting their degrees since the outcome is always going to be the same unskilled labour or unemployment regardless of education. Sites like indeed are supposed to offer a way to apply for jobs you want to try but the grand majority of the times you apply, you will not get a response, I'm convinced they're fake listings to create the illusion of a job market because I've never once found a job off those kind of sites, or even heard of anyone getting a reply. I hate my job and its nothing to do with what I wanted to work in or be at, but I'm still considered one of the lucky ones to even have employment and its sickening. I will never own a house in this country they're beyond extortionately expensive and half the time in squalid condition from years of financial neglect or slumlords running them into the ground. As I grew up watching the political climate of the UK year by year I can say I have never wanted to jump ship so badly in all my life, the situation is not looking likely to improve and I'm not willing to sick around on the gamble that it might, better yet I cant stay too long in Europe thanks to Brexit so I'm effectively stuck in this shit heap. I will dedicate my free time and effort to finding a way to leave and never return, whatever the cost may be ill pay it, ill endure it, ill stick it out till that window of opportunity opens and never look back.

You will regret it for the rest of your life. Careers in Arts/humanities are not that plentiful or lucrative. This is the situation even in developed countries. Majority of the regretted degrees around the world are in the arts/humanities stream.  Talking about preparing for govt jobs, you can get a government job even if you have a degree in STEM or business and the variety of jobs available will be a lot more. The chances of going abroad will also be limited if you take arts courses. A lot of the obsolete degrees need to be scrapped.  So guys, avoid arts at all costs. Get realistic guidance and select a better career. It's a stream with no future.  Please spread this message as much as possible sir 🙏",2025-06-03T20:48:55Z,18

I was sending out hundreds of applications every week and barely hearing anything back. Half are definitely ghost listings, I eventually picked up work at a small art gallery in NYC, then finally landed a spot at a tech startup. I thought things were turning around, but it was the same story everywhere. Every place I worked found a way to squeeze more out of me while paying less. Long hours, weekends, holidays; none of it mattered. And when it was convenient, they let me go. I only lasted 6 months at the tech startup, laid off due to AI.  At some point I just hit a wall. I figured if I was going to work this hard, it should be for something I actually care about. So I walked away from the mess and went all-in on aviation. Now I’m in flight school, working toward becoming a commercial pilot. Airlines at least offer real protections, solid benefits, and a career path that isn’t built on constant undercutting.

And i've seen like 20 companies POST for the same position EVERY OTHER MONTH, after I apply. It's like they are just posting to post without actually hiring anyone.",2025-12-10T22:32:29Z,2

It just says how many people, who are eligible for unemployment benefits, are actually receiving unemployment. If you quit your job (due to a toxic work environment), did not seek unemployment, gave up certifying for unemployment, your unemployment ran out, or otherwise didn’t qualify for unemployment / currently on unemployment but are still an adult before the retirement age who isn’t currently working, you aren’t counted towards the unemployment rate. That said, even if we assume that rate is twice as high (like 8% the eligible working population) which is overly generous, the point in the video still stands, but that would help explain why (1) it’s hard to get a job and (2) the perception of others without jobs being fairly high.  2) The unemployment cycle is extremely real. In addition to what’s mentioned in the video head hunters and job recruiters extremely favor those who are currently working than those who aren’t. They often assume that those who are unemployed lost their job because they’re incompetent, or not good to work with, and that they’re currently unemployed because they’re lazy. Furthermore, the longer you’re unemployed, the bigger the gap in your resume is making you easier to pass over by recruiters. Do what he says in the video and everything you do while unemployed in terms of training and self development, put it in your resume to fill the gap. It makes you look like you weren’t sitting on your thumbs just waiting for the next job to fall into your lap.  3) You can do everything right and still be unemployed for 6 months - 1.5 years. It sucks, but you have to remember it’s a numbers game and that this is ultimately a matter of luck (in essentially being in the right place at the right time). All you can do is increase your odds (and this video does do a good job at telling you how to do that), but be aware that you aren’t alone, and others have been in this situation you’re in or are currently going through it themselves. As he says, just keep at it (it’s all you can do at the end of the day anyway).",2025-05-16T13:42:55Z,695

For that statistic you would rather take youth (16-24) unemployment rate, that consists of high school/student graduates. The youth unemployment rate is 9.7%, which have grown almost percent since the last month. Especially the AI growth have played huge difference in the IT industry, where companies don't need to hire young candidates, cause the easy task can be done by AI. The market has also been over-saturated of IT students/workers and it will only be harder for them to get into IT. I've been a specialist in certain IT field for 2 years, got my job eliminated in company and couldn't find a job similiar to that for half a year. During that time my job applications have been ghosted, rejected couple hours after applying. And to be fair no side projects would make my situation any better, when my expierience wasn't even taken into consideration.",2025-05-18T12:58:16Z,106

But I assure you in the sea of thousands of job listings there is one out there for you. I recently secured a job with a company that uses workday after months of applying and almost calling it quits. I know how bad the struggle is but you should never stop applying. But most importantly don’t just apply to every job you think is a good fit for you.

Starting a business requires more than just ambition; it takes money, resources, and connections, which many graduates don’t have when they’re just starting out. It’s almost a catch-22: you need financial stability and experience to successfully launch something of your own, but the whole reason you’re trying to create a job is because you don’t have those things yet. On top of that, starting a business also carries risk—not just financially, but mentally and emotionally—which makes it an even steeper climb for someone who’s already struggling to find their footing in the workforce.",2025-08-31T18:13:33Z,402

And the entrepreneur’s point about education being a business? Painfully true. Much of what we learn is freely available, yet we pay for the certificate because HR systems still demand it.

That's what I did, and it worked extremely well.  Also, it gave me time to ""grow up"" and take my studies seriously as a young adult.  I don't know how people really expect 14 years old teenagers (9th graders) to take their studies seriously, but their grades determine what college they get in to, which will direct the course of their entire lives.  This is ridiculous IMO.  A 14 - 15 year old teenager needs an EXTREMELY disciplined household & lifestyle to maintain the study habits that will land him/her in a quality university.    Buuuuuut, if you go to JC, not only do you save money, but 1) None of your high school grades count anymore [when you transfer to a university they only view your JC grades,] 2) You save muuuuuuch money and you can work a job and pay out of your own pocket [like I did,] 3) You get a chance to grow up, live a little, become more mature and take your studies more seriously, 4) You can take a heavy or light load as you like, and take as much time in JC as you like [I spent 3.5 years at JC,] 5) If you're not comfortable with a class you can drop it and take a different one, take a different professor, etc., 6) You can change and try different majors if you need to [which I did twice,] 7) You finally transfer and enter university more mature with more resources, skills, and life experiences and you're not overwhelmed as an 18 year old kid who has just left your parent's house for the first time.  If you go to a JC first, you then transfer to a university as a 20 - 21 year old adult who has worked real jobs, had real adult relationships, have gotten the ""party bug"" out of your system [somewhat lol,] have had time to develop your ""real"" personality and you better know yourself apart from your parent's upbringing, and you're overall better prepared for university mentally, physically, emotionally, socially, and economically.  A lot of students enter college at 18 years old and get overwhelmed with their new adult life and responsibilities.  Going to JC first can help avoid all of that, and you will spend half the money.

These include the overall phenomenon called ""structural unemployment.""  Some economists have predicted this for decades because of its Malthusian essence.  Too many people, not enough jobs.  It will never return to what was.  It's not part of normal economic cycles that the experts are so fond of citing. It's exacerbated by AI and robotics.  Unless the government was proactive in planning to make society more socialistic, and improving conditions for citizens, then it's a down hill slide towards a plutocracy. Unfortunately that's the widening chasm between the rich and the poor, leaving the mid-class in tatters trying to maintain their standard of living in a country where the average person is involved in a non-consensual relationship with an economy hell bent on fleecing the shit out of people.  The automobile is the biggest fraud ever perpetrated on a populace. Just add up all the costs inherent in the operation of your car and hang up and drive.  The fender bender industry wants you on your phone, with headlights unique to each model and absurd prices for injection molded parts with insane margins. Back to the acyclic economic milieu in which we exist.  The end of the petroleum age means that we are seeing prices rise based on a truer calculation of embedded costs.   The slow death of urban core retail means that commercial real estate is getting shitty, and that sector has anchored funds and such for years.   Bankers are slow to adjust. Every company is squeezing everything for revenue, meaning the firings and the terrible job market are the tip of the iceberg. The guy who got voted in isn't doing anything to help you folks that believed the rhetoric.  He just wants to aggrandize himself and his cronies by reviving the polluting of our country while bad mouthing renewable energy because of its effect on the ""landscape.""   Since when has he given a shit about the natural world? Has he visited an open pit mine recently.  He has doubled his net worth over the last 6-18 months, while most US citizens are suffering.   Make no mistake: He doesn't give a shit about any of us, unless you're part of the war machine dominated by the Big 5 and go to Davos or Tetons.   Over Easter he dismissed us all and said ""just enjoy your life"" in a display of such callous indifference the average person's plight as to be obscene. He has begun to take away the basic right to free speech and his attacks on people smarter than he is who criticize what is happening is truly frightening.  We should all be very concerned and petition our generally greedy representatives who are often focused on their own inside information making their assisted stock market picks way easier. Stop attacking people who you might call liberal and understand that it will require all of us to find accord and quorum to achieve any progress.   Infighting and factionalism will be our downfall.",2025-09-08T00:43:25Z,11

The second problem is that at the low end of the income scale, you're often far better off choosing benefits as a career than a minimum wage job due to the differences in support schemes and taxes. Hence the massive increase in claims for nebulous conditions like ""anxiety"" or ""ADHD"", especially among young people.   The solution is to look to Denmark, where employment rights are surprisingly limited and make it easy to hire and fire employees. However, they can do this because fired workers get quite a generous amount of support from the welfare system, but that support is limited in time and scope. You're strongly pushed into training courses or looking for a job, and it'll get yanked after a couple of years. That means there's a good safety net that is only temporary, and businesses are more willing to hire people, safe in the knowledge that they can be binned off if they don't work out.",2025-11-13T13:45:10Z,3

This fully capitalist society, both on a corporate and country level, and the latter is especially so for singapore, has priced out people who actually need these resources.   People in their 30s cannot afford to be stuck in a situation where they have 30 year, 1 million dollar mortgages to pay off when the median salary is only 5.5k.   You are forcing people into desperate measures.  on the other hand, the government is offering tax breaks and subsidies to companies that end up not sharing the bottom line.  It is a pretty simple problem with a pretty simple solution: Tax those with plenty and tax less to those without.   If you are not going to tax, force the company to pay out the tax savings in salaries. companies will find a way to pay people properly and hire more. stress levels will decrease. productivity on a corporate level, either remains the same, or increases because all teams have more manpower. the only people that suffer are upper management and shareholders, whom are already making enough.  CEOs used to make 20 times more than a production worker. Now a CEO of a bank can make 300x more than a median salary worker. how do these upper management get a raise? by laying off people they dont like and keeping some of it as their profit. People at the top with super jobs just blame their surbordinates for the lack of production and fire them. dont see much job risk for them, and they only need to stay in those positions for 2 years to make what a normal person will make in a lifetime. When we question why they need to make so much, they justify by saying that they worked really hard with more responsibilities, but others havent. truth is, most people equally hard, but a selected, already rich few clog up the super jobs and dont give anyone else a chance. we havent even started to talk about what a shareholder makes, when generally shareholders do nothing for the company in terms of productivity.   Singapore repeatedly does this thing where they penalise the poor and make jt easy for the rich. i'd use the COE system as another example:  Those foreign family office rich families that come in are paying no tax on their capital gains and dividend distributions when they come to singapore. They obviously feel pretty good, with 1-2million in tax savings per year compared to if they were in the US or the UK. where does the money go into? Maybe those luxury cars we see on the road? They certainly wouldnt mind it that much if we raised the COE prices for them would they? eg. Just look at the taxes you pay on a Maserati (luxury car) compared to a Toyota (basic car). The flat COE price is 100k. The other taxes for the toyota is likely to be around 35k given current tax structure (i will spare the details). Comparatively, a person who buys the Maserati,  is paying about 120k in taxes. Again, bearing in mind the rich already save up 30-50% in capital gains and dividends taxes, how much does this flat 95k increase in taxes to buy a luxury car hurt them? NOTHING.  But the 100k for the COE prices out even those basic cars and people who actually need them. Give those in need this basic commodity and suddenly people will realise that they do not need to live that close to the MRT or a bus stop, which makes your road planning and the issue with uneven distribution across houses with different locations much easier to solve. Having a kid becomes much easier. People will be much happier.  There are so many ways to go about doing this: 1. Limit number of cars per person 2. Offer COE rebates to households with kids or elderly when they only have one car per family. 3. adjust the tax system i mentioned earlier to tax those Maseratis much much more so that those rich families cant stock up on 5 cars and jack up the COE. You might be able to get even more of a tax revenue from this. 4. Tax the purchase of a 2nd car much MUCH more. no matter what job you do, no one individual needs to drive 2 cars at the same time. if you are rich and you want to, you can, but you should get taxed much more.  Less rich people bidding = lower COE prices. Simple.  Sure, you might have more cars on the road during those peak hours, but solving the income inequality problem should be more of a priority, because the current system basically only continues to incentivise the rich and negate the poor.  solve the main problem: distribution of wealth, force the wealthy to share, and we all get a much happier society, with more people employed and a better worklife balance.",2025-08-27T20:16:57Z,13

Both Lena and Uzen look professional, sound great, but are facing numerous difficulties in landing a job - it is hard to explain.  One thing I noticed is that the speed of change in the hiring scene has been so fast with the use of automation and AI assisting in hiring tasks (such as reviewing and analyzing cover letters and resumes to design specific interview questions & batteries of tests for suitability).  Looking for a job has changed much from what I am familiar with.  What remains unchanged is the need to showcase your strengths when opportunities arise and impress your interviewer with your EQ & IQ.  In the meantime, while they wait for that job, it is a great time to explore other options that can help pay the bills.  Who knows, these short gigs can open new opportunities for them and bring them more job opportunities!  I wish them all the best in this brutal employment space :)",2025-08-22T05:47:58Z,3

Every job is a challenge and a compromise and the further you get out from your comfort home or country the more challenging it gets. That is where Indian youths who have been pampered at home fail abroad with social adjustment in a new society. They are home sick all the time. They should be concentrating on learning new language, new culture, new skills, seeing new places, experiencing the diversity and nature and even enjoying the quietness and lonliness filled with personal advancement. Glad that you pointed out many of these things here. Europe or any where else is definitely not a bed of roses. Nobody is waiting for you with open arms to give you a job, a home or a car. It is a healthy struggle here all the way minus nepotism, corruption, unequality and injustice which you are hopefully trying to get away from.",2025-08-17T10:46:07Z,0

It simply doesn't make sense to hire and train junior people when your company outlook is measured in quarters rather than decades, because they represent high risk of failure on critical short-term deadlines, compounded by high indirect cost to the productivity of the senior people that train them and could otherwise be focussed fully on critical tasks, both of which are naturally compounded by AI as an alternative, but existed well before it.  Add the pattern of company hopping that's more and more popular, which effectively means that training new people is paying for their next employer's benefit more than your own, and it's not hard to see why companies just don't want to deal with entry level people any more.  Of course, that's unsustainable in the long run, but for that, see both of the above: in a business where your incentives are quarterly and *you* expect to jump after a few years too, the long run is some future employee's problem, not yours.  Eventually I think we'll end up needing policy incentives for what I think of as ""sustainable hiring"" where there are subsidies or similar cost offsetting measures in place to encourage the creation of early career positions and training, because as senior people leave the workforce into retirement, there won't be enough young people gaining the experience to replace them, and that's not something companies are likely to fix for themselves in the current environment.",2025-12-02T16:43:14Z,127

That in turn leads to a decrease in quality of the end product, which in turn leads to less customer retention.  The effect isn't immediate, but give it a few more years and alot of large companies will suffer incredibly. Companies who hire real people with real skills will see the biggest return on investment.

Of the remaining 1,2 mio. people with degrees a third is 55+ with difficulties in acquiring new skills and a substantial number (I guess around 200k additionally) lives in so called lost regions of former industries both in the east and west. If you look at these numbers for Germany, the problem seems to be hiring freezes as the only ones that still hire are the state / government or any adjacent jobs to them. It doesn't look as bleak mid-term (roughly 400k more people retire from the workforce than young people entering it per year), yet that doesn't help in the short-term.   It is such a paradox situation, there is a lack of skilled workers and no one wants to hire the ones that are there due to the economic uncertainty and economic cooldown. Companies try to 'sit-it-out' till it gets better, a lot of my friends are overworked as companies put on more pressure instead of hiring new people. AI doesn't affect their jobs directly.   Guess everyone needs to skill up the next months to either prepare for a post-AI world (there will be jobs, yet the skills required are different) or go for another direction altogether (quite some people take double degrees now).

And the rest of the video is trying to explain why unemployment rate is rising (insignificantly), while in the beginning we saw that it's not rising (almost).  My one hypothesis for now is that while unemployment rate is constant, it may be still harder to change a job — it may be less people taking more time to find a new job, so the total number time×people is approximately constant. In case of IT it could be, for example, that companies consider much more candidates before choosing one due to some cultural shift after COVID, and that causes candidates to send much more resumes and spend much more time to find a new job (I mean AI resume filtering stage + more interviews for more candidates before hiring + more remote jobs to choose from a larger candidate pool). That's an assumption, I don't have hard data for this except for long term unemployment that grows faster than simple unemployment since early 2023.
