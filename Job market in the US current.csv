I worked at a restaurant and 5 of the new employees quit. For about a month and a bit I was doing their jobs and my own. When I went to my manager and refused to continue doing the work that the other 5 quit doing and just walked out I got fired… I wasn’t being paid for their jobs…   Karma got my manager though because when the owners found out I was given 5K! Turns out the owners were a Thai couple. The manager also got fired.   I was Offord my job back and I said no. I teach cricket to disabled people now. I love my job.

Edit- I've been getting a lot of people questioning if this was true, and it absolutely is. I agree, doesn't make sense at all to fire someone you've been praising for over a year as your best dish washer, and is currently your only dishwasher after the other guy retired, just for calling out for the very first time with a 103 degree fever and a doctor's note.  No, it's not illegal per se, because I live in a no fault state, but I did speak to a lawyer. He assured me I had a case, and that it was a guaranteed victory, but since I'd only just recently become full time, I hadn't made enough for the settlement to have been worth the lawyer fees. Even in no fault states, you can still sue if you're fired for discriminatory purposes, like being black, gay or sick.

They had a tough time getting rid of him because legally he did nothing wrong, he had only closed the store during his breaks that he was entitled to, he won the case of unfair dismissal as the company didn’t have enough evidence supporting his termination.

The episode explored the tragic circumstances surrounding their son, Adam Raine's suicide, alleging that ChatGPT incited the act.

They both lived with their parents because they felt that type of forced economic togetherness was starting a lifetime commitment based on money to survive, and very little left over to save. Without much light on the horizon.  With both paychecks working just to pay rent and vehicles to get them to work the reality was depressing them. . I now see the dilemma.

They can't advertise something that does not exist. It falls under ''false advertising''. Another good thing is that they must state the salary in their adverts.

Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss.

Until people come together and stand up and speak the truth we are screwed, people would rather sit in a lie and in denial than admit the man they voted for is making mistakes. i mean come on just because you vote someone in dont mean you must agree with them on everything, or does it. This man has made threats to any one who speaks against him, those who say anything, even if they were his biggest supporters  will be shamed for speaking and he will ignore their claims as lies or fake news, im just speaking the facts and I was a trump supporter myself but i will not sit here and pretend that everything is great, i wont pretend he is perfect and never makes mistakes, because we all do. and i think these tariffs were a big mistake, we needed to be making our own before we started any of this tariff stuff, we needed to have factories making the same things as these other countries whom price it by what it truely cost before taking stuff away from poor people who cannot afford certain things any other way. POOR people have literally survived because of cheap alternatives like temu and shein for years, there are kids whose entire christmas was all due to temu because their parents couldnt afford gifts for all their kids any other way. I really feel badly for lil kids whose parents no longer have that option, some of the stuff may be junk to some yes, but to a kid whose never been able to play barbies, that dupe barbie was the best thing since sliced bread. when you have never had to live like that you shouldnt go around saying that people are stupid for buying junk telling them to stop buying junk when its their only way to give their kids a bday or christmas with gifts like everybody else. i am very very worried about this country, and until TRUMP himself gets out of his own head and makes an effort to understand the people who helped win him his throne, things will keep getting worse, he will keep making decisions based off a life of luxury, he has no clue what its like to HAVE NO CHOICE but buy cheap to survive, he expects everybody to be able to make themselves into billionaires and the truth is we CANT not when you got billionaires like him making all the choices based off their own life instead of basing those choices on the lives of your most vulnerable people. because the consequences hit them first and foremost,  and they cannot afford any more consequences, people are at the edge of the cliff and anymore will push them on over that edge and thats when kids start getting taken from parents that can no longer afford to raise them, then your foster care program will be full to its max of kids without homes which our goernment and ourselves will fit the bill for later on. these tariffs have also messed up things like churches giving out free boxes of food, its caused homeless shelters to have to shut their doors, the ripples are rippling out and hitting in places we never thought about, places that rely soley on donations and cheaper products to feed the homeless and the poor arent able to get those things anymore, stores refuse to give anything away now, and those who broker deals with churches and such arent brokering those deals because they say they can no longer afford it, and these places arent able to buy things straight up off the shelf they HAVE to get it cheap or free or they cant get it and so people wont even have that as an option anymore if something dont change soon and fast. i pray i am wrong and he sees it before its too late and he jumps on it and makes these companies eat a lil more or else we are all doomed including HIM.",2025-08-08T09:15:30Z,5

They traded unemployment for underemployment, where graduates need to have as many jobs as the Jamaicans from that old In Living Color comedy sketch.

At this age I witnessed the transition between no smartphone to smartphones everywhere, no social media to social media everywhere. Now I’m witnessing houses being somewhat affordable to unaffordable and decent job market to tough harsh job market.   I know this might sound tone deaf but I can only say from my experience and what I’m seeing in my job field. I’m an aircraft tech at a major airline. I make $68/hr right now. 6 weeks vacation + 5 major holidays I can take off or bank + 12 sick days/year + decent 401k contribution. Reason I’m saying this is to spread information and also because airlines are MASS hiring to replace the boomers which was the majority of the work force leaving within 5 years. You don’t need a degree , but you do need a license which takes year and half.   Maybe consider switching career while you job hunt ? School is not difficult at all. If I got it, you can trust me. Yeah it’s not an office job , you will probably have to work midnights at first. You will work out in the element. But it’s a job that’s mass hiring. Boomers are leaving, they need to backfill.   Just throwing it out there for ya that can’t find a job. The way I’m seeing it is AI will replace more and more as it gets better and bettter.   Also this isn’t a job field only for men.

Yet here we are, with a surplus of degrees in the workforce, and many still find themselves in those same entry-level jobs. Employers used to see a degree as a clear path to opportunity, but now they demand experience—something that’s becoming harder to obtain. How are we supposed to gain that experience? There’s no such thing as a college for it.  On top of that, we’re warned not to job hop because it “looks bad” on a resume, even if we’re escaping a toxic workplace, dealing with layoffs, or other life challenges. For older Millennials, starting over with internships or volunteer roles isn’t an option—we need to support our families, and besides, wasn’t college supposed to prepare us for a career?  Even with a few years of experience under my belt, it’s still not enough. Companies want 10 to 20 years of experience for roles, but what happens if you’ve been laid off or had to leave a toxic job? To have that much experience, you’d have to reach a certain age—and then face age discrimination. I'm approaching 40, and I don't have the luxury of spending 5-10 years volunteering to gain more experience. Looking back, if I had known that companies prioritize skills and work experience over a degree, I would have skipped college and focused on volunteering or similar opportunities when I was younger. Although I did some of that, it still wasn’t enough.   The gap between rich and poor continues to grow, with the middle class slipping into obscurity. It’s a relentless cycle of unattainable expectations and limited opportunities, making upward mobility feel more like a fantasy than a possibility.",2024-12-31T02:08:24Z,550

But now they graduate buried in debt and the job they were looking for gone due to technology or downsized in highly competitive field. Average working Americans can't afford a car or home 2 of the basics of the American dream. Wages have stagnated but companies are profiting. But those profits are not being translated into wages not even a small portion. The new generation of worker is not going to work in this environment they quit quickly because they believe in showing the company as much loyalty as the company shows them.

When I was in college, I was graduating with a BA. I was told that the minimum position I should be applying for in any company is manager and be salaried. When I left college to once again enter the workforce, I was met with entry level jobs with entry level pay. Companies that were hiring managers wanted people who had years of experience as managers or higher degree. This was in 2013. The bar has been raised for entry into the job force and the expectations have also raised. It's no longer about doing a handful of tasks anymore.   As an example, bankers who used to just open and close accounts, are now doing loans and teller work. Loan officers barely exist anymore, unless they are in 1st position mortgages. And you would think that since these bankers have basically 3 people's jobs, that they would be paid more. Not really. $40k-60k/year is not enough to live on anymore. Retirement is now a 401k, not a pension, putting retirement at the employee's responsibility to pay in. This doesn't promote loyalty from employees. The companies don't care and cycle through employees that cannot meet their expectations or the employees leave on their own because they feel undervalued and under paid, and then the employers wonder why no one stays.

I had my apartment and wanted to save as well for a house and so my food budget was pretty much ramen and peanut butter sandwiches and staying home watching old tv shows and playing free video games and not going out with friends and things. When I finally paid off my student debt two years ago I managed to save up 20k for down payment on a house, I started looking into the whole process of buying a house only to find out that there was nothing in my city or surrounding counties that were remotely close to being affordable within my budget and I didn't want to live in a house I would grow to resent.   So I transferred from my job in the US to the same position in the EU and took my $20k deposit and bought a house here instead. I have a much better quality of life, achieved the dream of home ownership, and can enjoy other things in life rather than being trapped in an apartment living paycheck to paycheck.

For reference,  I teach industrial automation technologies how to set up, program, maintain and troubleshoot mechanical automation systems.  Setting up robotic assembly lines, building machines that build machines, etc.   I began teaching only a few years ago after many years in industry.   1. I was in the middle of the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Sometimes didn't know if I'd have a job next month because the plant was moving to overseas.  Also had to deal with many problems with parts and quality after those moves - and having to deal with supply chain when companies would decide to move their lines, but not build a product that directly replaced the one they quit making.  The corporate bottom line looked good, but the headaches from the people left was horrible, and worse, the devastation of the middle class was and is a reality.   2. The middle class is what made the US economy so strong, and it's a hollowed out shell.   Used to be, pretty much any job that wasn't flipping burgers was paying much more than minimum wage, and we didn't expect people to  go their entire lives on that pay.  It was for the kids in high school working part time or someone just out of school who was getting the entry level job that, in a month, or 3 or 6 was making much more than that.  Seriously, 20 years ago, minimum wage full time was less than 1% of the working population.   Actual middle class jobs were 75% of jobs (or more) and paid 10x that amount - AND you could afford to buy a car every couple of years, buy a house, and not have to go into future wage debt with credit cards.   Nowadays, people are trying to keep up appearances, but the US middle class is BROKE.    3. Companies have largely forgotten how to be loyal to employees. Used to be, you could get a job at age 20 or 25 and realistically could work there until retirement. And GROW, not just do the same job for 40 years.  The coming of the ""gig economy"" and the teaching by business schools of ""interchangeable economic units"" from a  Human Resources department had done a lot of the damage here.  Used to be, most middle and large sized companies had a significant training program in place where they would teach employees not only how to do their job, but also give them paths of advancement.   The disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street has choked that out.  For a long time,  you get hired for a job, and if you want a raise or a position advancement, you move somewhere else, instead of growing inside the company.    That seems to be changing a little... but not much. 4. These large tech corporations have done a marvelous job of publicly spreading risk while privately holding wealth - LLMs especially have been ripping off a lot of people from copyright, that, if it had been the other way, would have had the people getting sued - but the government has let the software companies get away with this ""for the greater good"" - even though it's pretty clear that LLMs are going to hurt a lot of people by not giving them a way into being productive. 5. Another dangerous thing about LLM - if it takes away the entry level ""easy"" tasks that are the training/honing tools for people to get good at, say, spotting cancers or other medical things - what happens in 10 or 20 years when all the current experts all die off? Who fills their shoes? If no one is allowed to get better because the job doesn't exist any more - then when there comes a time for the people to be there - where are they coming from?     Honestly, my field is the one area in manufacturing that still his hiring a lot of people - and we've kind of gone through that #5 part already - for many years the maintenance people didn't hire anyone because ""well, we've got Bob, and Bob knows everything"" - until Bob retires, or worse, drops dead from a heart attack...  now no one knows how to maintain the machines.  Smart companies have started waking up to that, and I keep praying the rest of industry does as well - but we've let too much money wreck the safeguards of government - and too many are focused on next quarter instead of next year or 5 years...   Meanwhile, I'm going to train as many people as I can, because when the robots do rise up, the people best able to defeat them are the ones who know how they work.",2025-09-06T14:59:40Z,166

If we want to bring back manufacturing in the USA, we need an aggressive push for trade schools, where people can learn the prerequisite skills to make accurate goods. In short, we kinda have to go through the process of building our country up, in very short order. Also, there's the investment in new equipment that matches the times. That costs billions of dollars. Who would want to pony up that kind of money with an untrustworthy president. Nobody knows what he will do next except for him. Investing in a new automated plant at this time could prove to be very risky. I don't see our government creating any incentive programs, so you can be assured that it will not get done.

Then try and find local job postings for SMALL businesses. And I mean small. Big tech will replace lower end employees faster than small mom and pop places who care about people. Aim to have enough, not excess. Learn to be content, not grinding. You will find happiness moment to moment, not in large clumps.

My advice to you guys is always have a seperate mission statement and always write a follow up email or shows up to the place and ask for any updates once. This puts you on top of the other 99% of applicants who just apply and doesn't do anything else. We grant an interview 100% of the time if you just do these two things because there are hundreds of applicants and we appreciate if the individual hussle just a little more than the rest.,2025-08-31T14:04:05Z,50

The sad thing is a lot of my peers were told “just do your schooling, and a job will be handed to you” this was not really the case ever, but it was easier to keep applying and the numbers eventually came in your favour.

Our biggest clients all work in manufacturing, as we write SAP software, which is used throughtout most of the German manufacturing and automotive industry (and many more). As I am in charge of our AI development projects myself, and have even implemented the proof of concept AI basis using keras on tensorflow for our data mining AIs while using a locally hosted LLM for our LLM-based project proof, I know AI and I know the technology.  However, in none of these corporations you could claim that AI is being used in a production-ready context. We (as a thirdparty SAP-based software supplier) are way ahead of other competitors in the same field, as we have a few AI products already ready for use. However, those products are the only ones our customers have ever seen in their automation and system context. And to this day I have to essentially always start from 0, when talking to any customer about AI.  No, the industry IS NOT USING AI IN PRODUCTION. Corporations are using ""AI"" as a neat excuse for not hiring because their business is just so bad these days (which they tell us often, when we suggest large-scale projects as we did before Covid). First all corporations blamed covid for their bad numbers, then it was the Ukraine war and now it is AI. The reason changes but the effect is the same: A bad economic recession and the current scapegoat is ""AI automation"".  So please, when you hear a corporation is not hiring because they automated the position using AI, just know that they are not hiring because they simply cannot afford to pay you, as their business is going slowly right now. To this day I have not seen even one AI product in production - and our smallest customer has around 10k employees worldwide. So if even they are not using AI in production - who is!?  ---------------------------------  One more comment: And don't forget the irony, that so many people claim AI will be taking developer jobs. If I knew how, I would automate half my work in home-office and simply be payed the same for less effort. But no, AI is so damn stupid that it is like a self-writing wikipedia, but barely anything more. Just today I was using AI for reading up on a specific python framework's documentation, and the AI gave me a stupid suggestion on which API to use for a specific use case. The example the AI (claude 4) gave me already contained another API method which could be used instead, and made everything else unnecessary. But - being a stupid AI - I had to tell the AI exactly that, after which it obviously responded with ""blablabla you are totally correct blablabla"". So even though as a product architect on this subject, I am also the leading dev. on everything AI, I still did not find any way to get the AI to write useful code for us. Because I essentially have to tell the AI everything I told students, when I was teaching at a German university over 10 years ago. It's frustrating and makes no sense to even try - just hire someone who knows these things, instead of trying to ""educate"" an AI every time you see it doing some nonsense BS. Because no static prompt you can give the bot, will actually make it stick to your rules, as it arbitrarily ignores them.   So no - AIs are not going to take any complex or engineering jobs. But it will take jobs/tasks related to art or entertainment. Because in these jobs failure is not hard, but ""only"" results in a less satisfying customer experience, instead of a total production or process failure.",2025-08-13T18:22:00Z,911

There is a narrative being pushed by media outlets that is totally unsupported by any evidence. They are simply taking it as a given that AI is both a real thing and the reason layoffs are occurring. When any of these people are asked to defend this claim, which is extraordinarily rare, they merely point to the existence of layoffs as all the evidence needed to show AI is the cause. I'm sorry, WTF? During the 08 crisis, we were seeing 750k job losses PER MONTH. Was that because of AI? This asinine form of reasoning would suggest so. Layoffs did not just begin when ChatGPT was released and the occurrence of layoffs is not, in anyway, indicative of the rise of AI. Actual evidence would be citing literally any examples of a company using AI instead of workers. Show me an LLM automating an entire workflow. I DARE YOU.

There is actually a very similar case: what happened with welders. Industrial robots made the profession obsolete, so companies stopped hiring and training new welders, and the profession lost its prestige. However, there are certain tasks that require highly skilled employees, for example in the oil and chemical industries and underwater welding. Many older workers have already retired. Companies now compete for a very small pool of people who can perform such tasks, and these people know how valuable they are and charge accordingly. Shelf projects costing billions in investments depend on these people, and sometimes HR has to wait months for a person with the right skills to become available from another site. Needless to say, these employees are millionaires. However, companies are reluctant to invest in training such employees in-house as it takes decades — far longer than a typical CEO's term.",2025-11-20T22:43:17Z,13

I'll share an example of how our AI platform enabled someone to climb the corporate ladder. A company that sells TV mounts had a purchaser who was working overtime juggling spreadsheets before our AI platform dropped his workload to just 3 hours a month. This freed him up to be creative.

I was able to get rehired in my professional career due to AI after years of being unemployed despite having decades of experience in my industry. My last job I was let go due to AI. So for years while I searched for a new job, I avoided taking up job listings that featured AI roles in their work.  Eventually though I realized I had to bite the bullet and at least try one of the jobs that feature AI. And I was recently given an offer that requires heavy use of it.   What I quickly found out about the company though: Is that they were using AI incorrectly. They were mostly using it as a crux on covering skill sets the other employers didn't have. So I decided to use rebuild how the AI content was used: With good old fashion human skills and training.   As a result: The profits of the company have already shot up exponentially, and we're already now looking to expand the division of the company I was hired for with other skilled employees. We're starting to succeed where other startups are struggling. But it just goes to show that AI can only be used as a tool when used with proper skills and training, not as a replacement for human interaction.",2025-11-21T02:31:57Z,7

So this was already a huge problem, and the inclusion of foreign contractors in countries with significantly lower costs of living changes it, but doesn’t _dramatically_ change it. It’s an acceleration, not an inflection point.   Which doesn’t mean that it’s not bad or not worth talking about. And the acceleration can make a thing that was a minor problem around the edges into a society-undermining problem. But most humans are very bad at recognizing creeping threats, very bad at planning for nebulous threats, and bad-to-very-bad at cognitive empathy. So I think the lack of conversation reflects lack of recognizing that this is a systemic problem. Thanks for bringing it up!  But I also think this reflects factionalism and lack of much trans-national worker solidarity to counterbalance the power of transnational corporations. In the US, big transnational corporations and some politicians have for 50+ years mostly succeeded in scapegoating workers in lower-COL countries and pitting US workers against them. Most of the US unions completely fell for this in the 1970s-1990s, pushing to prevent offshoring of manufacturing jobs through contracts and legislation, instead of pushing to unionize the foreign workers. They saw foreign workers as unfair  competition instead of recognizing the corporations and shareholders as the source of the problem.",2025-08-17T20:28:24Z,33

Henry Ford saw this and changed the manufacturing game yet everyone ignores those lessons these days! It doesn't help your company that primarily relies on US based people buying your stuff to then fire all those Americans! It's literally stupid!",2025-09-07T23:41:15Z,1
