Took a shower at the gym and went to work etc... It wasn’t as cold as Germany but still was a scary and humbling experience. There are many people like that here. They aren’t even addicts/mentally ill etc… they just can’t afford apartments here. The tens of thousands that sleep on the streets is another story.,2025-03-26T19:28:21Z,1188

I was nearly homeless four years ago when my landlady gave me only four weeks notice of rental contract termination. It was horrible... nobody even wanted to rent me a WG room because I am PhD student with ridiculously low-income and short-term working contracts with no guarantees of extension. Only few days before my rental contract ended I managed to get a place to stay which is in horrible conditions - in the cellar, no sunlight, full of mold, horrible plumping issues, constant backflow of sewage water in the shower cabin which of course gives horrible smell. And of course in the middle of nowhere, super far from the city center and from my university. Of course my landlords violate many laws in here. Of course they knew I am a  poor Eastern European PhD student living from paycheck to paycheck in this expensive city all by myself, and I cannot afford hiring a lawyer against them. It was the biggest mistake of my life to start PhD in Munich... Luckily this nightmare is coming to the end, hopefully I will get my degree in summer and next month I am finally leaving Germany for good! :)",2025-05-01T20:38:29Z,382

Interesting I learned how to code and do stuff like pivot tables and work in Quickbooks. However also earned another degree with my CS one which was Philosophy. Many view it as stupid, but was very fun/easy to understand while many couldn't do the critical Philosophy classes. I thought as a kid, ""getting/doing Computer Science/IT will help A LOT for my future"", looks like that's not the case. The job market sucks and cannot find a job.

Problem comes when everyone starts doing that to raise their share value, since less people are employed sales drop, then they cut even more employees to make up that loss. The cycle then repeats until the market collapses one day, but the government refuses to step in, instead opting to double down and make it collapse earlier because they don't care if the US falls they just need to be in power after the fall.",2025-08-29T02:40:03Z,6

This isn't to say the female nurses are bad, but the men willing to deal with the stigma are the same that will work their tail off for the sake of being there for passion not paycheck.  It also helps with male nurses being around as it also gives some men a more solid and sympathetic connection. There are things culturally that male nurses and male patients can address that female nurses either aren't really exposed to or that the patient doesn't feel comfortable addressing with a female nurse.

I don't understand what's going on. Government says ""we need qualified employees"". The quality of IT services and of products shows also that a lot needs to be developed. So we have a vision/mojo from 1 and a work to do from 2. German efficiency is a joke in this situation. I came to do the useful IT stuff, ended up learning German 4h/d 5d/w to reach B2 (have A2 now) for 1-2 years. Applying to everything: juniors, internships, seniors. Either germans don't feel the global competition yet and the growing economical problem will help to feel it properly and probably to start some investments to growing as at least some special english-speaking-while-learning-german internships, or gov's mojo needs to be switched to smthng like ""we need qualified German speaking employees"". But more likely that politicians will play with the problem for own favor for some time and nothing will change. I will learn the language for sure. But it's inefficient. We both spending our time in favor to global competitors, while we were able to do things in parallel.",2025-02-20T21:58:08Z,13

While the United States, the UK, and much of Europe are distracted by political churn, migration paralysis, and short-term thinking, Wuzhou is building patiently and at scale. As Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong mature and saturate, Wuzhou offers strategic depth, lower constraints, and long-term capacity. It reflects China’s enduring model: infrastructure first, industry second, innovation constrained by state capacity rather than speculative excess.

You cant leave as well because it will cancel your anmeldung which you need to do every time you change accommodation so you cannot even visit other EU countries as a tourist to save money. For short term 3 to 4 months yes this visa makes sense to get feel for market and give your best shot but not for 12 months since this is not even a resident permit but stupid 12 month tourist visa asking for funds upfont making it worse than getting 2 year schengen visa instead which allows freedom to change countries without any nonsense city registration.,2025-12-12T02:45:03Z,0

Not worth it, just delay your coming . Learn language and come. Not basics but B2 or C1.  Not even B1. People who already have jobs are not changing any company bcz of  language requirement .
